1994, c. 44, s. 
20


1. Paragraph 334(a) of the Criminal Code 
is replaced by the following:










(a) is guilty of an indictable offence and 
liable to imprisonment for a term not 
exceeding ten years, where the property 
stolen is a testamentary instrument or what 
is stolen is not a motor vehicle but has a  
value exceeding five thousand dollars; or









2. The Act is amended by adding the 
following after section 334:







Theft of a 
motor vehicle 
of a certain 
value


334.1 (1) Every one who commits theft of 
a motor vehicle where the value of that vehicle 
exceeds five thousand dollars is guilty of an 
indictable offence and liable










(a) in the case of a first offence, to 
imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten 
years; and









(b) in the case of a subsequent offence, to 
imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten 
years and to a minimum punishment of 
imprisonment for a term of four years.






Definition of 
``subsequent 
offence''


(2) In subsection (1), ``subsequent offence'' 
means a subsequent offence within the 
meaning of subsections (3) and (4).







Interpreta-
tion


(3) Where a person is convicted of an 
offence under subsection (1) and at the time 
the offence was committed the person had 
been previously convicted of an offence under 
that subsection, the offence is a subsequent 
offence for the purposes of paragraph (1)(b).







Interpreta-
tion


(4) Where a person is convicted of an 
offence under subsection (1) and is then 
convicted of another offence under that 
subsection, that other offence shall, for the 
purposes of paragraph (1)(b), be deemed to be 
a subsequent offence where the offence was 
committed before the earlier conviction.







For greater 
certainty


(5) For greater certainty, for the purposes of 
subsection (4), a conviction for another 
offence under subsection (1) includes a 
conviction for another offence under 
subsection (1) arising out of the same event or 
series of events.
