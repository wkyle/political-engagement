49-50 Elizabeth II, 2001 










House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-262









An Act to establish the rights of fishers 
including the right to be involved in the 
process of fisheries stock assessment, fish 
conservation, setting of fishing quotas, fishing 
licensing and the public right to fish and 
establish the right of fishers to be informed of 
decisions affecting fishing as a livelihood in 
advance and the right to compensation if other 
rights are abrogated unfairly







Preamble


Whereas the primary objective of fisheries 
policy is to maintain successful and 
sustainable fisheries;










 Whereas those Canadians who fish for a 
livelihood are the people most affected by and 
most knowledgeable about the conservation 
of successful and sustainable fisheries;










 Whereas the best decisions regarding the 
protection, development and harvesting of 
fish stocks can only be made with the 
involvement of the fishers who fish those 
stocks;










 Whereas it is necessary to ensure that 
decisions affecting fisheries will be made by 
processes that involve fishers;










 Whereas there should be a right of 
compensation for fishers whose fishing rights 
are abrogated by a decision reached by a 
process that does not involve fishers;










 And Whereas the public right to fish 
should also be protected by involving fishers 
in decisions respecting that right;










 Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with 
the advice and consent of the Senate and 
House of Commons of Canada, enacts as 
follows:
