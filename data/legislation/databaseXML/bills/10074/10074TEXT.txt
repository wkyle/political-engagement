Annual 
adjustment

payable under this Act, the basic monthly 
amount of that allowance shall be adjusted 
annually, in such manner as may be prescribed 
by the Governor in Council, so that the amount

payable for that month if no adjustment had

for the twelve month period ending on the 
thirty-first day of October immediately

period immediately before that twelve 
month period.






Meaning of 
certain 
references


(2) In this section and section 14,










(a) a reference to the Consumer Price Index

average of the Consumer Price Index for 
Canada, as published by Statistics Canada

each month in that twelve month period;

(b) a reference to the basic monthly amount 
of any allowance shall be construed as a 
reference to the amount of that allowance, 
expressed in terms of a monthly amount and 
calculated without regard to the provisions 
of this section.






Limitation


13. Notwithstanding anything in section 12, 
the amount of any allowance that may be paid 
to a person for a month in any calendar year 
shall not, by reason only of that section, be less 
than the amount of the allowance that was or 
may be paid to that person for any month in the 
immediately preceding calendar year.







Where basis 
of Consumer 
Price Index 
changed


14. Where at any time the Consumer Price 
Index for Canada, as published by Statistics 
Canada under the authority of the Statistics 
Act, is adjusted to reflect a new time basis or 
a new content basis, a corresponding 
adjustment shall be made in the Consumer 
Price Index for any twelve month period that 
is used for the purpose of calculating the 
amount of any allowance that may be paid.
