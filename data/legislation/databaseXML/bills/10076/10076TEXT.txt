PART XIII.1 - OFFENCES BY 
CORPORATIONS, DIRECTORS AND 
OFFICERS







Interpreta-
tion


467.3 (1) In this section, ``management of 
a corporation'' in respect of an act or omission 
means all or any of










(a) the one or more persons who, being 
directors or officers of the corporation are 
responsible for the direction and control of 
the part of the activity of the corporation in 
respect of which the act or omission occurs; 
and









(b) the one or more persons to whom the 
corporation has delegated the day-to-day 
management of that part of the activity of 
the corporation.






Corporate 
offences


(2) Where it is shown that an act or omission 
has been committed on behalf of a 
corporation, directly or indirectly by the act or 
pursuant to the order of one or more of its 
officers, employees or independent 
contractors, and










(a) the act or omission was authorized by 
the management of the corporation either as 
a specific authorization of the act or 
omission, or by following a policy 
established by or a practice authorized or 
allowed by the management of the 
corporation,









(b) the act or omission was tolerated, 
condoned or encouraged by the policies or 
practices established by or permitted to 
subsist by the management of the 
corporation, or the management of the 
corporation could and should have been 
aware of but was wilfully blind to the act or 
omission,









(c) the management of the corporation had 
allowed the development of a culture or 
common attitude among its officers and 
employees that encouraged them to believe 
that the act or omission would be tolerated, 
condoned or ignored by the corporation, or









(d) the management of the corporation, 
whether or not it knew of the act or 
omission,









(i) failed to take steps that a reasonable, 
prudent and responsible corporation 
should take so that its officers and 
employees would know that such acts or 
omissions, or acts or omissions of the 
same or a similar nature, were unlawful 
or forbidden by the corporation, or









(ii) failed to provide procedures and 
practices whereby such acts or omissions 
would come to its notice,









the corporation is guilty of every offence of 
which an individual could be found guilty for 
committing that act or omission.







Penalty


(3) A corporation guilty of an offence under 
subsection (2) is liable










(a) on summary conviction to a fine not 
exceeding $50,000; or

(ii) in the case of an offence under section 
231 (murder) or section 236 
(manslaughter), not exceeding 
$10,000,000.






Commission 
and 
authorization 
by different 
persons


(4) For a corporation to be guilty of an 
offence under subsection (2), it is not 
necessary to show that the person who 
committed or ordered the act or omission was 
or was a part of the management of the 
corporation involved in the manner described 
in paragraphs (2)(a) to (d).







Burden of 
proof


(5) Where it is shown that an act or omission 
that constitutes an offence was committed or 
ordered by an officer, employee or 
independent contractor of the corporation, the 
onus is on the corporation to show that it was 
not carried out in the circumstances described 
in paragraphs (2)(a) to (d).







Directors and 
officers


467.4 (1) Every one who is a director or 
officer of a corporation that is guilty of an 
offence under section 467.3 who










(a) alone or with others authorized the act or 
omission that constituted the offence, or









(b) knew or ought to have known, as a result 
of circumstances described in paragraph 
467.3(2)(b), (c) or (d) that the act or 
omission that constituted the offence was 
being committed, or would or would be 
likely to take place, and failed to take all 
reasonable steps to prevent its commission, 
including, in the case where the act or 
omission was being committed or was 
authorized, reporting the matter to a peace 
officer or to an official or agency of 
government having authority over health or 
safety at the workplace in question,









is guilty of an offence and liable on conviction 
as if committed personally and liable to the 
same penalty as if the director or officer had 
committed the act or omission personally.







Factors 
considered


(2) In determining whether a director or 
officer of a corporation knew or ought to have 
known that an act or omission would or would 
be likely to take place, the court shall consider 
the experience, qualifications and duties of 
the director or officer.







Unsafe 
workplace


467.5 Every corporation that permit unsafe 
working conditions to exist, or that fails to 
take all reasonable steps to provide safe 
working conditions for its employees, is guilty 
of an indictable offence and liable on 
conviction to a fine of not more than $100,000 
for every day on which the unsafe working 
conditions are shown to have subsisted.







Directors' and 
officers' 
liability


467.6 (1) Every one who is a director or 
officer of a corporation that is guilty of an 
offence pursuant to section 467.5 who knew or 
who ought to have known that unsafe working 
conditions existed is guilty of an indictable 
offence and liable on conviction to










(a) a fine of not more than $10,000 for every

and did not take the steps referred to in 
section 467.5, or









(b) imprisonment









(i) for a term of not more than seven

conditions result in the death of any 
person,

Factors 
considered
