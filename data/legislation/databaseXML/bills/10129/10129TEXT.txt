BILL C-297









An Act to promote the observance of two 
minutes of silence on Remembrance Day










 Whereas the people of Canada are forever 
grateful to the many dedicated men and 
women who bravely and unselfishly gave 
their lives for Canada in wars and in 
peace-keeping efforts;










 Whereas their extraordinary courage and 
profound sacrifice must never be forgotten by 
us or future generations;










 And Whereas, as a gesture of its respect for 
these men and women, the federal 
government wishes to honour their memory 
by promoting throughout Canada the 
observance of two minutes of silence each 
Remembrance Day,










Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:

Suggestions


3. The following are suggested as ways in 
which the people of Canada could promote the 
pause and observance of the two minutes of 
silence:










(a) they could participate in a traditional 
Remembrance Day service at a war 
memorial or cenotaph;









(b) if they are driving, they could stop their 
vehicles along the side of the road and sit 
quietly for two minutes, where this is 
allowed and where it does not endanger the 
driver of the vehicle or others;









(c) they could gather in common areas in 
their workplaces to observe the two minutes 
of silence together;









(d) where possible, assembly lines could be 
shut down in factories for two minutes;









(e) Remembrance Day assemblies could be 
held in schools, colleges and universities; 
and

held in places of worship.
