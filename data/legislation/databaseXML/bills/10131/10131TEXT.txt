BILL C-16

Her Majesty, by and with the advice and 
consent of the Senate and House of Commons 
of Canada, enacts as follows:









SHORT TITLE






Short title


1. This Act may be cited as the Charities 
Registration (Security Information) Act.










PURPOSE AND PRINCIPLES






Purpose


2. (1) The purpose of this Act is to show 
Canada's commitment to participate in 
concerted international efforts to deny support 
to those who engage in terrorism, to protect 
the integrity of the registration system for 
charities under the Income Tax Act and to 
maintain the confidence of Canadian 
taxpayers that the benefits of charitable 
registration are made available only to 
organizations that operate exclusively for 
charitable purposes.







Principles


(2) The purpose of this Act is to be carried 
out in recognition of, and in accordance with, 
the following principles:










(a) maintaining taxpayers' confidence may 
require reliance on information that, if 
disclosed, would injure national security or 
the safety of persons; and









(b) the process for relying on the 
information referred to in paragraph (a) in 
determining eligibility to become or remain 
a registered charity must be as fair and 
transparent as possible having regard to 
national security or the safety of persons.

the opinion that disclosure of the 
information would injure national security 
or the safety of persons;









(b) provide the applicant or the registered 
charity with a statement summarizing the 
information available to the judge so as to

safety of persons;

EVIDENCE






Evidence


7. For the purposes of subsection 6(1), the

relevant information, whether or not the 
information is or would be admissible in a 
court of law, and base the determination under 
paragraph 6(1)(d) on that information.







Admission of 
foreign 
information 
obtained in 
confidence


8. (1) For the purposes of subsection 6(1), in 
private and in the absence of the applicant or

or from an institution or an agency of an 
international organization of states; and









(b) the judge shall examine the information 
and provide counsel representing the 
Minister or the Minister of National 
Revenue with a reasonable opportunity to 
be heard as to whether the information is 
relevant but should not be disclosed to the

counsel representing it because the 
disclosure would injure national security or 
the safety of persons.






Return of 
information


(2) The information shall be returned to 
counsel representing the minister who made 
the application and shall not be considered by 
the judge in making the determination under

information

is relevant but that its disclosure would injure 
national security or the safety of persons, the 
information shall not be disclosed in the 
statement mentioned in paragraph 6(1)(b), but 
the judge may base the determination under 
paragraph 6(1)(d) on it.







Ineligibility or 
revocation


9. (1) A certificate that is determined to be 
reasonable under paragraph 6(1)(d) is 
conclusive proof that, in the case of an 
applicant, it is ineligible to become a 
registered charity or, in the case of a registered 
charity, that it does not comply with the 
requirements to continue to be a registered 
charity.
