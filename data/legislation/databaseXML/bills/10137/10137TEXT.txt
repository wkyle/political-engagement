BILL C-333









An Act to establish and maintain a national 
registry of sex offenders to protect the 
children and communities of Canada







Preamble


Whereas, the people of Canada believe that 
there is a need to ensure the safety and security 
of all persons in Canada and that police forces 
require access to information about the 
whereabouts of sex offenders in order to assist 
them in the important work of maintaining 
community safety;










 Whereas the people of Canada believe that 
a national registry of sex offenders will 
provide the information and investigative 
tools that their police forces require in order to 
prevent and solve crimes of a sexual nature;










Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and the 
House of Commons of Canada, enacts as fol
lows:
