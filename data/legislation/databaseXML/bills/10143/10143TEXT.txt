House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-345









An Act to amend the Immigration Act 
(requirement to show evidence of 
identity)










Her Majesty, by and with the advice and 
consent of the Senate and House of Commons 
of Canada, enacts as follows:









1. Section 19(1) of the Immigration Act is 
amended by adding the following after 
paragraph (b):










(b.1) subject to subsections 44(2.4) and 
(2.5), persons who are unable to show 
evidence of their identity, except a claimant 
for Convention refugee status in respect of 
whom a senior immigration officer has 
made an order, pursuant to subsection 
44(2.4) that has not been cancelled pursuant 
to subsection 44(2.5), that the 
circumstances of the claimant's departure 
from the country of origin or travel to 
Canada made it impossible or 
impracticable to bring such evidence;  









2. Section 44 of the Act is amended by 
adding the following after subsection (2):







Evidence of 
identity


(2.1) Subject to subsection (2.5), no person 
who claims to be a Convention refugee shall 
be permitted to come into or remain in Canada 
unless the person shows evidence of identity.







Showing 
identity


(2.2) A person who arrives in Canada 
claiming to be a Convention refugee must be 
asked within seven days of arrival to 
immediately produce evidence of identity 
satisfactory to an immigration officer.







Removal from 
Canada


(2.3) If the immigration officer determines 
that a person referred to in subsection (2.1) 
does not have satisfactory evidence of 
identity, the person shall be removed from 
Canada forthwith.







Exception


(2.4) A person referred to in subsection 
(2.3) may, within forty-eight hours of being 
advised of the determination, give notice to 
appeal the determination to a senior 
immigration officer who shall, within seven 
days of the notice, hold a hearing to determine 
whether sufficient evidence of identity was 
offered or if no, why the claimant does not 
have sufficient evidence of identity and, if the 
senior immigration officer is satisfied that the 
circumstances of the claimant's departure 
from the country of origin or travel to Canada 
made it impossible or impracticable to bring 
such evidence, the officer may order, subject 
to such conditions as the officer may impose 
respecting the later determination of the 
claimant's identity, that subsection (2.1) does 
not apply to the claimant.







Cancellation 
of order


(2.5) A senior immigration officer who 
determines that an order under subsection 
(2.4) was obtained by false or incomplete 
information or that any condition the order 
was subject to has been breached, may cancel 
the order.







Decision final


(2.6) The decision of a senior immigration 
officer under subsection (2.4) or (2.5) is final 
and is not subject to appeal.
