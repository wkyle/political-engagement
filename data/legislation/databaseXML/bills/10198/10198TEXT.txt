BILL C-369









An Act to amend the Income Tax Act 
(donations to food banks)







Preamble


 Whereas many Canadians find themselves 
unable to afford nutritious food to feed 
themselves and their families;










 Whereas food banks perform a valuable 
service in providing food to persons in need;










 And Whereas it is desirable to encourage 
the donation of food to food banks, especially 
food that would otherwise be wasted;










 Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with 
the advice and consent of the Senate and 
House of Commons of Canada, enacts as 
follows:










 






R.S., cc. 1, 2 
(5th Supp.)


1. The Income Tax Act is amended by 
adding the following after section 259:







Definitions

``food''
« nourriture »


``food'' means food fit for human 
consumption that may, under any 
applicable public health law in force in the 
place where the food is located, be lawfully 
given or distributed;







``food bank''
« banque 
d'alimentatio
n »


``food bank'' means a registered charity 
whose primary purpose is to provide food 
free of charge to persons in need in Canada.







Charitable gift


(2) For the purposes of sections 110.1 and 
118.1, a donation of food to a food bank is 
deemed to be a charitable gift, 
notwithstanding that the cost of the food 
donated is also deducted as an expense in 
calculating the taxpayer's income.







Fair market 
value


(3) The fair market value of food to which 
subsection (2) applies is deemed to be the 
actual cost of the food to the taxpayer, not
