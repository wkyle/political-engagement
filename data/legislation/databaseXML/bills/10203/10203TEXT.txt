« fonctionnair
e supérieur »

is designated under subsection (5).







Principle


(2) It is in the public interest to ensure that 
public officers may effectively carry out their 
law enforcement duties in accordance with the 
rule of law and, to that end, to expressly 
recognize in law a justification for public 
officers and other persons acting at their 
direction to commit acts or omissions that 
would otherwise constitute offences.







Designation 
of public 
officers


(3) A competent authority may designate 
public officers for the purposes of this section 
and sections 25.2 to 25.4.







Condition - 
civilian 
oversight


(3.1) A competent authority referred to in 
paragraph (a) or (b) of the definition of that 
term in subsection (1) may not designate any 
public officer under subsection (3) unless 
there is a public authority composed of 
persons who are not peace officers that may 
review the public officer's conduct.







Declaration as 
evidence


(3.2) The Governor in Council or the 
lieutenant governor in council of a province, 
as the case may be, may designate a person or 
body as a public authority for the purposes of 
subsection (3.1), and that designation is 
conclusive evidence that the person or body is 
a public authority described in that subsection.







Consideration
s


(4) The competent authority shall make 
designations under subsection (3) on the 
advice of a senior official and shall consider 
the nature of the duties performed by the 
public officer in relation to law enforcement 
generally, rather than in relation to any 
particular investigation or enforcement 
activity.







Designation 
of senior 
officials


(5) A competent authority may designate 
senior officials for the purposes of this section 
and sections 25.2 to 25.4.







Emergency 
designation


(6) A senior official may designate a public 
officer for the purposes of this section and 
sections 25.2 to 25.4 for a period of not more 
than 48 hours if the senior official is of the 
opinion that










(a) by reason of exigent circumstances, it is 
not feasible for the competent authority to 
designate a public officer under subsection 
(3); and









(b) in the circumstances of the case, the 
public officer would be justified in 
committing an act or omission that would 
otherwise constitute an offence.









The senior official shall without delay notify 
the competent authority of the designation.







Conditions


(7) A designation under subsection (3) or 
(6) may be made subject to conditions, 
including conditions limiting










(a) the duration of the designation;









(b) the nature of the conduct in the 
investigation of which a public officer may 
be justified in committing, or directing 
another person to commit, acts or omissions 
that would otherwise constitute an offence; 
and









(c) the acts or omissions that would 
otherwise constitute an offence and that a 
public officer may be justified in 
committing or directing another person to 
commit.






Justification 
for acts or 
omissions


(8) A public officer is justified in 
committing an act or omission - or in 
directing the commission of an act or omission 
under subsection (10) - that would 
otherwise constitute an offence if the public 
officer










(a) is engaged in the investigation of an 
offence under, or the enforcement of, an Act 
of Parliament or in the investigation of 
criminal activity;









(b) is designated under subsection (3) or (6); 
and









(c) believes on reasonable grounds that the 
commission of the act or omission, as 
compared to the nature of the offence or 
criminal activity being investigated, is 
reasonable and proportional in the 
circumstances, having regard to such 
matters as the nature of the act or omission, 
the nature of the investigation and the 
reasonable availability of other means for 
carrying out the public officer's law 
enforcement duties.






Requirements 
for certain 
acts


(9) No public officer is justified in 
committing an act or omission that would 
otherwise constitute an offence and that would 
be likely to result in loss of or serious damage 
to property, or in directing the commission of 
an act or omission under subsection (10), 
unless, in addition to meeting the conditions 
set out in paragraphs (8)(a) to (c), he or she










(a) is personally authorized in writing to 
commit the act or omission - or direct its 
commission - by a senior official who 
believes on reasonable grounds that 
committing the act or omission, as 
compared to the nature of the offence or 
criminal activity being investigated, is 
reasonable and proportional in the 
circumstances, having regard to such 
matters as the nature of the act or omission, 
the nature of the investigation and the 
reasonable availability of other means for 
carrying out the public officer's law 
enforcement duties; or









(b) believes on reasonable grounds that the 
grounds for obtaining an authorization 
under paragraph (a) exist but it is not 
feasible in the circumstances to obtain the 
authorization and that the act or omission is 
necessary to









(i) preserve the life or safety of any 
person,









(ii) prevent the compromise of the 
identity of a public officer acting in an 
undercover capacity, of a confidential 
informant or of a person acting covertly 
under the direction and control of a 
public officer, or









(iii) prevent the imminent loss or 
destruction of evidence of an indictable 
offence.






Person acting 
at direction of 
public officer


(10) A person who commits an act or 
omission that would otherwise constitute an 
offence is justified in committing it if










(a) a public officer directs him or her to 
commit that act or omission and the person 
believes on reasonable grounds that the 
public officer has the authority to give that 
direction; and









(b) he or she believes on reasonable grounds 
that the commission of that act or omission 
is for the purpose of assisting the public 
officer in the public officer's law 
enforcement duties.






Limitation


(11) Nothing in this section justifies










(a) the intentional or criminally negligent 
causing of death or bodily harm to another 
person;









(b) the wilful attempt in any manner to 
obstruct, pervert or defeat the course of 
justice; or









(c) conduct that would violate the sexual 
integrity of an individual.






Protection, 
defences and 
immunities 
unaffected


(12) Nothing in this section affects the 
protection, defences and immunities of peace 
officers and other persons recognized under 
the law of Canada.







Compliance 
with 
requirements


(13) Nothing in this section relieves a public 
officer of criminal liability for failing to 
comply with any other requirements that 
govern the collection of evidence.







Exception: 
offences 
under 
Controlled 
Drugs and 
Substances 
Act


(14) Nothing in this section justifies a 
public officer or a person acting at his or her 
direction in committing an act or 
omission - or a public officer in directing the 
commission of an act or omission - that 
constitutes an offence under a provision of 
Part I of the Controlled Drugs and Substances 
Act or of the regulations made under it.







Public officer 
to file report


25.2 Every public officer who commits an 
act or omission - or directs the commission 
by another person of an act or 
omission - under paragraph 25.1(9)(a) or (b) 
shall, as soon as is feasible after the 
commission of the act or omission, file a 
written report with the appropriate senior 
official describing the act or omission.







Annual report


25.3 (1) Every competent authority shall 
publish or otherwise make available to the 
public an annual report for the previous year 
that includes, in respect of public officers and 
senior officials designated by the competent 
authority,

subsection 25.1(6) by the senior officials;









(b) the number of authorizations made 
under paragraph 25.1(9)(a) by the senior 
officials;









(c) the number of times that acts and 
omissions were committed in accordance 
with paragraph 25.1(9)(b) by the public 
officers;









(d) the nature of the conduct being 
investigated when the designations referred 
to in paragraph (a) or the authorizations 
referred to in paragraph (b) were made or 
when the acts or omissions referred to in 
paragraph (c) were committed; and









(e) the nature of the acts or omissions 
committed under the designations referred 
to in paragraph (a), under the authorizations 
referred to in paragraph (b) and in the 
manner described in paragraph (c).






Limitation


(2) The annual report shall not contain any 
information the disclosure of which would










(a) compromise or hinder an ongoing 
investigation of an offence under an Act of 
Parliament;









(b) compromise the identity of a public 
officer acting in an undercover capacity, of 
a confidential informant or of a person 
acting covertly under the direction and 
control of a public officer;
