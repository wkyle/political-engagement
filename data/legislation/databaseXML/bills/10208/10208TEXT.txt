BILL C-370









An Act respecting the rights of children







Preamble


Whereas the United Nations has, in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
in the International Covenants on Human 
Rights, proclaimed and agreed that everyone 
is entitled to the rights and freedoms set forth 
therein without distinction of any kind such as 
race, colour, sex, language, religion, political 
or other opinion, national or social origin, 
property, birth or other status;










 Whereas the United Nations has, in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
proclaimed that childhood is entitled to 
special care and assistance;










 Whereas the family, as the fundamental 
group of society and the natural environment 
for the growth and well-being of all its 
members and particularly children, should be 
afforded the necessary protection and 
assistance so that it can fully assume its 
responsibilities within the community;










 Whereas every child, for the full and 
harmonious development of personality, 
should grow up in a family environment in an 
atmosphere of happiness, love and 
understanding;










 Whereas every child should be fully 
prepared to live an individual life in society 
and be brought up in the spirit of the ideals of 
the Charter of the United Nations, and in 
particular in the spirit of peace, dignity, 
tolerance, freedom, equality and solidarity;










 Whereas the need to extend particular care 
to the child has been stated in the Geneva 
Declaration of the Rights of the Child of 1924, 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and 
the statutes and relevant instruments of 
specialized agencies and international 
organizations concerned with the welfare of 
children;










 Whereas every child, by reason of physical 
and mental immaturity, needs special 
safeguards and care, including appropriate 
legal protection;










 And Whereas the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms guarantees many but not 
all of the rights mentioned in this preamble;










Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:
