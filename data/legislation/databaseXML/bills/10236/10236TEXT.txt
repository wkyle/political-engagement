R.S., cc. 3, 27 
(2nd Supp.)


Her Majesty, by and with the advice and 
consent of the Senate and House of Commons 
of Canada, enacts as follows:









1. (1) Subsection 16(3) of the Divorce Act 
is replaced by the following:







Application 
by other 
person


(3) A person, other than a spouse or a parent 
of a spouse , may not make an application 
under subsection (1) or (2) without leave of the 
court.










(2) Subsections 16(9) and (10) of the Act 
are replaced by the following:







Past conduct


(9) In making an order under this section, 
the court shall not take into consideration the 
past conduct of any person unless the conduct 
is relevant to the ability of that person to act in 
the best interests  of the  child.







Maximum 
contact


(10) In making an order under this section, 
the court shall give effect to the principle that 
a child of the marriage should have as much 
contact with each spouse and each parent of a 
spouse  as is consistent with the best interests 
of the child and, for that purpose, shall take 
into consideration the willingness of the 
person for whom custody or access  is sought 
to facilitate such contact.










2. (1) Subsection 17(2) of the Act is 
replaced by the following:







Application 
by other 
person


(2) A person, other than a former spouse or 
a parent of a former spouse,  may not make an

leave of the court.










(2) Subsection 17(9) of the Act is replaced 
by the following:







Maximum 
contact


(9) In making a variation order varying a 
custody order, the court shall give effect to the 
principle that a child of the marriage should 
have as much contact with each former spouse 
and each parent of a former spouse  as is 
consistent with the best interests of the child 
and, for that purpose, where the variation 
order would grant custody of or access to  the 
child to a person who does not currently have 
custody or access , the court shall take into 
consideration the willingness of that person to 
facilitate such contact.







Review after 
three years


3. (1) On the expiration of three years 
after the coming into force of this Act, its 
provisions shall be referred to such 
committee of the House of Commons, of the 
Senate or of both Houses of Parliament as 
may be designated or established for that 
purpose.







Report

established for the purposes of 
subsection (1) shall review the provisions 
and operation of this Act and, within six 
months after the review is undertaken or 
within such further time as the House of 
Commons may authorize, shall submit a 
report to Parliament thereon, including its 
recommendations as to whether the 
provisions of this Act should be continued 
or changed and specifying any changes it 
recommends.
