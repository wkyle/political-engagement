affairs in a manner that will bear the closest 
public scrutiny;









(b) in fulfilling their official duties and

under a financial or other obligation to 
outside individuals or organizations that

to the public;









(e) ministers shall be open about all the 
decisions and actions that they take;

influence on their private interests, the 
ministers shall divest themselves of such 
interests;
