SUMMARY









The purpose of this enactment is to establish the Business Bank of 
Canada as a lender of guaranteed student loans and to provide that 
student loan interest rates are set at the rate of inflation for the previous 
year and are adjusted annually.










This will ensure that students and those still paying off student loans 
have reasonable financing and are not unduly burdened by debt after 
completing their education.










Those who have existing loans from the lenders previously 
established by the Canada Student Loans Act will be able to apply for 
loans from the Business Development Bank to pay them off and will 
then be covered by the new interest provisions.
