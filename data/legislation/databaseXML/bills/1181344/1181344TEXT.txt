SUMMARY









This enactment improves the protection of the assets of pension plan 
members and beneficiaries by










(a) ensuring that they have substantial representation on boards of 
trustees, pension committees and pension councils;









(b) putting into the Act a 10% limit on the amount of pension assets 
that may be held in the securities of the employer (the limit is 
presently in the regulations);









(c) preventing members and beneficiaries from being restricted in 
trading the employer's securities unless the directors and officers are 
similarly restricted, and in any event for not more than a year; and









(d) protecting members and beneficiaries by providing that they 
must receive information that will or may affect the value of 
securities at the same time it is released to anyone other than the 
directors, officers, management and advisors of the employer.
