SUMMARY









This enactment promotes the public interest by establishing a regime 
for dealing with wrongdoing in the Public Service. The regime will be 
centred in the Public Service Commission, under the direction of a 
commissioner to be designated as the Public Interest Commissioner.










Under the regime, employees will be able to give notice of wrongful 
acts or omissions. The Commissioner will be able to investigate and 
report allegations of wrongful acts or omissions and see that actual 
wrongdoing is dealt with. Ministers of the Crown will be able to learn 
of wrongdoing from the Commissioner, and will be expected to deal 
with it.










The Public Interest Commissioner will ensure a positive 
environment for the regime by providing for education on ethical 
practices in the workplace and on the rights and responsibilities of 
employees under this Act with respect to wrongdoing in the Public 
Service.
