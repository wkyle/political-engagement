SUMMARY









The purpose of this enactment is to provide for a referendum to be 
held on the question of whether public funds should be used for 
medically unnecessary abortions. If the electors agree that this should 
not be the case, an amendment to the Canada Health Act will be brought 
into force which will allow a reduction in fiscal transfers to provinces 
that allow such funding.
