SUMMARY









The purpose of this enactment is to change section 281 of the 
Criminal Code which currently provides for the offence of abduction of 
a person under the age of 14 years by a person other than the person's 
parent or guardian. The section is amended so that it applies to the 
abduction of a person under the age of 16 years.
