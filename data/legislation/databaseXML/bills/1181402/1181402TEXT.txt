SUMMARY









The purpose of this enactment is to allow employees to deduct the 
cost of providing tools for their employment if they are required to do 
so by the employer as a condition of employment. The deduction 
includes an allowance in respect of the capital cost of the tools and 
rental, maintenance and insurance expenses.










Regulations would set the appropriate depreciation rates applicable 
to the capital costs for various types of tools.
