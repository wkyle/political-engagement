SUMMARY









The purpose of this enactment is to provide cost of production 
protection to family farms in cases where the weighted average input 
cost of products typical in or suitable for the farming zone exceeds the 
weighted average netback to farm gate of such products, averaged over 
three years.










Costs are to be calculated on the basis of marketable product and thus 
will take into account bad weather, pests and other crop loss factors.










The calculations are to be based on normal crops or livestock 
produced for food or breeding and are to be approved by an independent 
auditor.










The enactment does not provide for support on product-by-product 
basis and is not therefore a direct product subsidy.
