SUMMARY









This enactment amends the Interest Act. It provides that a financial 
institution that makes a mortgage or hypothec loan of five hundred 
thousand dollars or less to a natural person must allow the person to 
repay the loan before its maturity, in return for the payment of 
prescribed interest in lieu of notice.










The financial institutions to which this enactment applies are banks 
to which the Bank Act applies, companies to which the Trust and Loan 
Companies Act applies and foreign companies to which the Insurance 
Companies Act applies.










The enactment also provides that such financial institutions shall, in 
the manner prescribed by regulation, include a statement in the 
mortgage document written in plain language, in terms generally 
understood by the public, explaining whether the borrower may repay 
the mortgage loan before maturity and the circumstances in which the 
borrower may exercise that right.
