SUMMARY









This enactment amends the Corrections and Conditional Release 
Act to provide that any person who receives a sentence as a result of 
being convicted of an indictable offence while on conditional release 
must serve the remainder of the original sentence and at least two-thirds 
of the new sentence.










In addition, it provides that, if a person has been convicted on more 
than one occasion of an indictable offence committed while on 
conditional release, the person will not be eligible for conditional 
release in respect of any new sentence.










This enactment also provides for the repeal of sections 742 to 742.7 
of the Criminal Code and the elimination of cross-references to these 
sections in other provisions of that Act. Sections 742 to 742.7 allow the 
courts to impose conditional sentences, which are served in the 
community, in respect of convictions for offences for which a minimum 
term of imprisonment is not prescribed.
