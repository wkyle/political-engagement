SUMMARY









This enactment amends the Criminal Code and provides that, where 
a peace officer believes on reasonable and probable grounds that a 
person has operated a motor vehicle in a dangerous manner and has 
thereby caused the death of another person, the peace officer shall, by 
demand made to that person forthwith or as soon as practicable, require 
that person to provide such a urine sample as is necessary to enable 
proper analysis to be made in order to determine the presence, if any, of 
drugs in the person's urine, and










(a) such samples of the person's breath as in the opinion of a 
qualified technician are necessary, or









(b) where the peace officer has reasonable and probable grounds to 
believe that, by reason of any physical condition of the person,









(i) the person may be incapable of providing a sample of his 
breath, or









(ii) it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of the person's 
breath,









such samples of the person's blood, under the conditions referred to 
in subsection 254(4) as in the opinion of the qualified medical 
practitioner or qualified technician taking the samples are necessary 
to enable proper analysis to be made in order to determine the 
concentration, if any, of alcohol in the person's blood.
