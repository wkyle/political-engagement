SUMMARY









This enactment repeals section 522 of the Criminal Code. This 
removes the existing power of a judge of a superior court of criminal 
jurisdiction to grant interim release to a person accused of one of the 
very serious offences listed in section 469. These are offences relating 
to treason, alarming Her Majesty, intimidation of Parliament, inciting 
mutiny, sedition, piracy, bribery by a judicial officer, murder, etc.










The enactment also forbids interim release of a person accused of an 
offence under section 264 (criminal harassment), 272 (sexual assault 
with a weapon) or 273 (aggravated sexual assault), if there is direct 
evidence of identification. It provides that, if an application for interim 
release of such a person is brought before a justice, and the justice is 
satisfied that there is credible or trustworthy evidence of identification 
of the accused by a victim or witness, the application shall be refused.










These amendments are carried out by sections 5 and 6. The 
remaining sections are amendments to the Act necessary to make 
changes that result from sections 5 and 6 and to remove references to 
the process referred to in the repealed section 522.
