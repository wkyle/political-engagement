SUMMARY









The purpose of this enactment is to require regulations to be made 
to require aircraft registered in Canada that provide a commercial 
passenger service to carry automatic external defibrillators on all flights 
that have a scheduled duration between take-off and landing of one hour 
or more. The operator of the aircraft must also ensure that at least one 
of the crew on such flights is trained in the use of such defibrillators. 
Small aircraft may be exempted until a later date or indefinitely to allow 
for the benefit of experience in the working of the regulations.










The provision of a defibrillator will enable the flight crew to give 
interim assistance to any passenger who suffers a cardiac arrest during 
a flight. This reduces the level of the medical crisis by stabilizing the 
passenger and it is likely to save lives.










In addition, it will become less often necessary to divert flights for 
medical assistance. As diversions are extremely costly and inconve
nient and can result in many other flights being delayed, the cost of the 
defibrillator will be partly offset by operational savings.










A further problem of unscheduled landings for medical reasons is 
that an aircraft may have to choose between landing with a full fuel load 
or dumping fuel to land safely. This also would be reduced.










The regulations will be enforced by the existing provisions of the 
Act.
