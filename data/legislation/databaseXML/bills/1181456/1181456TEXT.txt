SUMMARY









This enactment amends the Criminal Code to make it an offence for 
anyone who possesses child pornography, whether created by the 
person or obtained from another source, to allow another to access it or 
to fail to take reasonable steps to prevent access by any other person.










This applies at all times, including times when the person is 
accessing the material.










As the reasonable steps are specified as those that would be normal 
for a prudent person to take, the obligation is one that must be carefully 
fulfilled even though it is not absolute.
