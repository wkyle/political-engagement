SUMMARY









This enactment amends the provisions of subsection 742.6(9) of the 
Criminal Code, which deal with an offender who has breached a 
condition of a conditional sentence order. The Act provides directions 
to a court when an offender has, without reasonable excuse, which is to 
be proved by the offender, breached a condition of the conditional 
sentence order.










This enactment removes the court's options of taking no action; 
changing the optional conditions; or suspending the order and requiring 
a part of the sentence to be served in custody with the order resuming 
for the balance of the sentence.










It therefore requires the court, in such circumstances, to terminate the 
conditional sentence order and order that the sentence be served in 
custody.










Subsection 742.7(2) of that Act is amended solely to make the 
necessary consequential change to the reference to subsection 742.6(9).
