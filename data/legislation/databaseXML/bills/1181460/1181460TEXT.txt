SUMMARY









This enactment amends the Criminal Code to require a court, in 
passing a sentence of two years or more of imprisonment, to make an 
order specifying the minimum security level of the incarceration for the 
first third of the sentence.










Several provisions of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act 
are amended in consequence, to ensure that the security level of the 
incarceration is no less than that specified in the order of the court.
