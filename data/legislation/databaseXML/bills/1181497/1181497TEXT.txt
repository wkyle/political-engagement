SUMMARY









This enactment provides for privacy of patients' health records and 
restricts the uses to which the information in such records may be put. 
It deals with the different contexts in which information is given or 
collected, the issue of informed consent, the circumstances in which 
consent may be implied and the scope of a consent.










It provides different categories of use and places restrictions on the 
form of information for these uses. Patient privacy impact analysis will 
be necessary for all uses that do not relate to the health treatment of the 
patient and the information for such uses must be made anonymous.










The Privacy Commissioner may investigate complaints alleging 
non-compliance. Offences and penalties are established.
