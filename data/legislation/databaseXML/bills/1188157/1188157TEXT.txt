52-53 ELIZABETH II









CHAPTER 2











An Act respecting assisted human 
reproduction and related research










[Assented to 29th March, 2004] 










Her Majesty, by and with the advice and 
consent of the Senate and House of Commons 
of Canada, enacts as follows:









SHORT TITLE






Short title


1. This Act may be cited as the Assisted 
Human Reproduction Act.










PRINCIPLES






Declaration


2. The Parliament of Canada recognizes 
and declares that










(a) the health and well-being of children 
born through the application of assisted 
human reproductive technologies must be 
given priority in all decisions respecting 
their use;









(b) the benefits of assisted human 
reproductive technologies and related 
research for individuals, for families and for 
society in general can be most effectively 
secured by taking appropriate measures for 
the protection and promotion of human 
health, safety, dignity and rights in the use 
of these technologies and in related 
research;









(c) while all persons are affected by these 
technologies, women more than men are 
directly and significantly affected by their 
application and the health and well-being of 
women must be protected in the application 
of these technologies;









(d) the principle of free and informed 
consent must be promoted and applied as a 
fundamental condition of the use of human 
reproductive technologies;









(e) persons who seek to undergo assisted 
reproduction procedures must not be 
discriminated against, including on the 
basis of their sexual orientation or marital 
status;









(f) trade in the reproductive capabilities of 
women and men and the exploitation of 
children, women and men for commercial 
ends raise health and ethical concerns that 
justify their prohibition; and









(g) human individuality and diversity, and 
the integrity of the human genome, must be 
preserved and protected.
