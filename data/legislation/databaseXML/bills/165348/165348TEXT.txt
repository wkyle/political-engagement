49-50 Elizabeth II, 2001 










House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-









An Act to provide for adequate, accessible and 
affordable housing for Canadians







Preamble


 Whereas the provision of and access to 
adequate housing is a fundamental human 
right according to paragraph 25(1) of the 
United Nations Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, which reads as follows:










``Everyone has the right to a standard of 
living adequate for the health and 
well-being of himself and of his family, 
including food, clothing, housing and 
medical care and necessary social 
services, and the right to security in the 
event of unemployment, sickness, 
disability, widowhood, old age or other 
lack of livelihood in circumstances 
beyond his control.'';









 Whereas in 1976 Canada signed the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights, a legally binding treaty, 
committing Canada to make progress on fully 
realizing all economic, social and cultural 
rights, including the right to adequate 
housing, as outlined in paragraph 11(1) of the 
Covenant:










``The States Parties to the present 
Covenant recognize the right of everyone 
to an adequate standard of living for 
himself and his family, including 
adequate food, clothing and housing, and 
to the continuous improvement of living 
conditions. The States Parties will take 
appropriate steps to ensure the 
realization of this right.'';









 Whereas the enjoyment of other human 
rights, such as those to privacy, to respect for 
the home, to freedom of movement, to 
freedom from discrimination, to 
environmental health, to security of the 
person, to freedom of association, and to 
equality before the law are indivisible from 
and indispensable to the realization of the 
right to adequate housing;










 Whereas the immediate action required of 
State Parties to the Covenant arises out of 
paragraph 2(1) of the Covenant, which 
provides that State Parties undertake to take 
steps to carry out its provisions by all 
appropriate means, including particularly the 
adoption of legislative measures;










 Whereas the United Nations Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has 
interpreted this to mean that State Parties are 
obliged to immediately begin to adopt 
measures towards the full enjoyment by 
everyone of the right to housing;










 Whereas the United Nations Committee 
has been highly critical of Canada's failure to 
make progress on the provision of adequate 
housing for all Canadians, a criticism made 
most recently in its concluding observations 
of December 10, 1998:










``The Committee is gravely concerned 
that such a wealthy country as Canada 
has allowed the problem of homelessness 
and inadequate housing to grow to such 
proportions that the mayors of Canada's 
10 largest cities have now declared 
homelessness a national disaster.'';









 Whereas the United Nations Committee 
issued a specific recommendation that Canada 
implement a national strategy aimed at 
reducing homelessness and poverty, which 
reads in part:










``The Committee recommends that the 
federal, provincial and territorial 
governments address homelessness and 
inadequate housing as a national 
emergency by reinstating or increasing, 
as the case may be, social housing 
programs for those in need, improving 
and properly enforcing 
anti-discrimination legislation in the 
field of housing, increasing shelter 
allowances and social assistance rates to 
realistic levels, providing adequate 
support services for persons with 
disabilities, improving protection of 
security of tenure for tenants and 
improving protection of affordable rental 
housing stock from conversion to other 
uses. The Committee urges the State 
Party to implement a national strategy for 
the reduction of homelessness and 
poverty.'';









 Whereas Canada's wealth and national 
budget are more than adequate to ensure that 
every woman, child and man residing in 
Canada has secure, adequate, accessible and 
affordable housing as part of a standard of 
living that will provide healthy, physical, 
intellectual, emotional, spiritual and social 
development and a good quality of life;










 Whereas achievement of improved 
housing conditions is best realized through 
co-operative partnerships of government and 
civil society and the meaningful involvement 
of local communities;










 And Whereas the Parliament of Canada 
wishes to ensure the establishment of national 
goals and programs that seek to improve the 
quality of life for all Canadians as a basic 
right;










Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:
