BILL C-420









An Act to amend the Broadcasting Act 
(reduction of violence in television 
broadcasts)







Preamble


Whereas violence is a major cause for 
concern in our society;










 Whereas, under the Broadcasting Act, 
broadcasting licensees take full responsibility 
for the programs they broadcast;










 Whereas it is recognized that the 
broadcasting of violent scenes is one of the 
factors related to violence in society;










 Whereas censorship is not a solution;










 Whereas the creative freedom of workers 
in the television industry must be protected;










 Whereas it is also necessary to assume 
responsibility for the protection of children;










 Whereas the broadcasting industry has its 
own codes and classification systems against 
violence on television, instruments that have 
been approved by the Canadian 
Radio-television and Telecommunications 
Commission;










 And Whereas the number of violent scenes 
broadcast on television during the hours when 
children watch television, namely, before 
9 o'clock p.m., has nevertheless increased;
