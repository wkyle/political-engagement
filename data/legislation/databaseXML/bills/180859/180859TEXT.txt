House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-427









An Act respecting the adjustment of credit 
card charges in cases where goods or 
services are not supplied or are defective







Preamble


Whereas transactions involving the use of 
credit cards are frequently interprovincial or 
international transactions;










 And Whereas Parliament wishes to add 
security to interprovincial and international 
trade involving the use of credit cards by 
protecting consumers who do not receive 
goods and services that they have paid for by 
charging them to a credit card;










Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:
