unless it conforms to the definition of ``milk'' 
in section 2.







Composite 
milk products


(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), the 
term ``milk'' may be used in association with 
another word or other words to designate 
composite milk products if a clear description 
of the modification to which the milk has been 
subjected is shown in close proximity to the 
name.







Milk of other 
mammals


(3) Notwithstanding subsection (1), the 
normal mammary secretion from a mammal 
other than a cow, genus Bos, may be marketed 
as ``milk'' if the genus of the mammal from 
which it was taken is shown in immediate 
proximity to the word ``milk''.







Adjusted 
products


(4) Notwithstanding subsections (1) and 
(2), milk that is adjusted for fat or protein 
content, and that is intended for direct 
consumption, may also be named ``milk'' if










(a) it is sold only where such adjustment is 
permitted in the province where it is sold at 
retail;









(b) the minimum and maximum limits of fat 
or protein content, as the case may be, of the 
adjusted milk are specified in the 
legislation of the province where it is sold 
at retail;









(c) the adjustment has been performed 
according to methods permitted by the 
legislation of the province where it is to be 
sold at retail, and only by the addition or 
withdrawal of milk constituents, without 
altering the whey protein to casein ratio; 
and









(d) the milk is labelled to state that it has 
been adjusted in accordance with the 
provisions of the legislation of the province 
where it is sold at retail.






Use of dairy 
terms


(5) A dairy term may be used in association 
with another word or other words to designate 
a composite milk product, if










(a) no part takes or is intended to take the 
place of any milk constituent; and









(b) the milk or milk product is an essential 
part either in terms of quantity or for 
characterization of the qualities of the 
product.






Use of dairy 
terms for 
composite 
milk products


(6) A product complying with the 
descriptions in subsection (2) or (4) may be 
named ``milk'' or given the name specified for 
a milk product, if










(a) a clear description of other 
characterizing ingredients, such as foods, 
spices, herbs and flavours, is given in close 
proximity to the name; and









(b) the terms are used to designate 
composite milk products of which no part 
takes or is intended to take the place of any 
milk constituent and of which milk or a milk 
product is an essential part either in terms of 
quantity or for characterization of the 
qualities of the product.






Use of dairy 
terms for 
other foods


(7) A dairy term may be used only to label 
or identify milk, milk products or composite 
milk products, in accordance with subsections 
(1) to (6).







Exception for 
certain users


(8) Subject to subsection (9), the use of a 
dairy term in the name of a food product is 
permitted when the exact nature of the food 
product is clear from traditional usage or when 
the dairy term is clearly used to describe a 
characteristic quality of the food product.







Substitutes 
excepted


(9) In the event that a food product, or an 
ingredient of a food product, is intended to 
substitute for milk or a milk product, dairy 
terms shall not be used for that food product, 
except as permitted by subsection (10).







Uses not 
permitted


(10) Subject to subsection (11), no label or 
other description may be used, in marketing a 
food that is not milk, a milk product or a 
composite milk product, that claims, implies 
or suggests that the product is milk, a milk 
product or a composite milk product, or that 
refers to one or more of these products.







List of 
ingredients


(11) In the case of a food that contains milk 
or milk products, the term ``milk'' or any other 
dairy term may be used in the list of 
ingredients of that food.







Use of term 
``milk 
flavour''


(12) No person shall market a food labelled 
with the words ``flavour'' or ``taste'' in 
conjunction with the word ``milk'' or a dairy 
term if the product is not milk, a milk product 
or a composite milk product.







Transitional 
period


7. Where a use of a dairy term for a food 
established prior to the date on which this Act 
comes into force, sections 5 and 6 do not apply 
to that use until the date that is one year after 
the date on which this Act comes into force.







Indication of 
substitutes on 
menus


8. In an establishment where food that is 
ready for consumption is served for a 
consideration, for consumption on or off the 
premises, no person shall offer or serve any 
substitute without so informing the consumer 
by an indication on the menu or, if there is no 
menu, on a sign or label.
