The House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-115









An Act respecting fisheries







Preamble


 Whereas the powers, duties and functions 
of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans extend 
to sea coast and inland fisheries;










 Whereas Parliament intends that those 
powers, duties and functions be exercised to 
conserve and manage Canada's fisheries in the 
interest of present and future generations of 
Canadians;










 Whereas Parliament intends that those 
powers, duties and functions, as well as 
responsibilities under the fisheries laws of 
Canada, be exercised and performed in a 
manner that fosters cooperation with the 
provinces and other states and is consistent 
with Canada's international rights and 
obligations;










 Whereas cooperation by foreign states 
with respect to the conservation of fisheries 
resources outside Canada's waters affects the 
conservation of Canada's fisheries resources;










 Whereas Canada promotes the broad 
application of a precautionary approach to the 
conservation, management and exploitation 
of marine resources in order to protect marine 
resources and preserve the marine 
environment;










 Whereas the protection of fish habitat and 
the prevention of the pollution of waters 
frequented by fish are essential elements of 
the management of Canada's fisheries;










 Whereas the conservation of Canada's 
fisheries and their management on a 
sustainable basis are central to the economic 
viability of persons engaged in fishing and fish 
processors and the well-being of communities 
that are dependent on fisheries resources;










 Whereas persons engaged in fishing and 
their organizations wish to have a greater and 
more direct participation in decisions 
respecting the management of Canada's 
fisheries;










 And whereas the sustainability of Canada's 
fisheries depends on the application of 
effective deterrents to illegal fishing;










Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:
