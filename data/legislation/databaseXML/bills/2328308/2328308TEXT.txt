Alternative Measures






When 
alternative

be used


717. (1) Alternative measures may be used 
to deal with a person alleged to have 
committed an offence only if it is not 
inconsistent with the protection of society and 
the following conditions are met:










(a) the measures are part of a program of 
alternative measures authorized by the 
Attorney General or the Attorney General's 
delegate or authorized by a person, or a 
person within a class of persons, designated 
by the lieutenant governor in council of a 
province;









(b) the person who is considering whether to 
use the measures is satisfied that they would 
be appropriate, having regard to the needs 
of the person alleged to have committed the 
offence and the interests of society and of 
the victim;









(c) the person, having been informed of the 
alternative measures, fully and freely 
consents to participate therein;









(d) the person has, before consenting to 
participate in the alternative measures, 
been advised of the right to be represented 
by counsel;









(e) the person accepts responsibility for the 
act or omission that forms the basis of the 
offence that the person is alleged to have 
committed;









(f) there is, in the opinion of the Attorney 
General or the Attorney General's agent, 
sufficient evidence to proceed with the 
prosecution of the offence; and









(g) the prosecution of the offence is not in 
any way barred at law.






Restriction on 
use


(2) Alternative measures shall not be used 
to deal with a person alleged to have 
committed an offence if the person










(a) denies participation or involvement in 
the commission of the offence; or









(b) expresses the wish to have any charge 
against the person dealt with by the court.






Admissions 
not admissible 
in evidence


(3) No admission, confession or statement 
accepting responsibility for a given act or 
omission made by a person alleged to have 
committed an offence as a condition of the 
person being dealt with by alternative 
measures is admissible in evidence against 
that person in any civil or criminal 
proceedings.







No bar to 
proceedings


(4) The use of alternative measures in 
respect of a person alleged to have committed 
an offence is not a bar to proceedings against 
the person under this Act, but, if a charge is 
laid against that person in respect of that 
offence,










(a) where the court is satisfied on a balance 
of probabilities that the person has totally 
complied with the terms and conditions of 
the alternative measures, the court shall 
dismiss the charge; and









(b) where the court is satisfied on a balance 
of probabilities that the person has partially 
complied with the terms and conditions of 
the alternative measures, the court may 
dismiss the charge if, in the opinion of the 
court, the prosecution of the charge would 
be unfair, having regard to the 
circumstances and that person's 
performance with respect to the alternative 
measures.






Laying of 
information, 
etc.


(5) Subject to subsection (4), nothing in this 
section shall be construed as preventing any 
person from laying an information, obtaining 
the issue or confirmation of any process, or 
proceeding with the prosecution of any 
offence, in accordance with law.







Records of 
persons dealt 
with


717.1 Sections 717.2 to 717.4 apply only in 
respect of persons who have been dealt with 
by alternative measures, regardless of the 
degree of their compliance with the terms and 
conditions of the alternative measures.

alleged to have been committed by a person, 
including the original or a copy of any

offence.

participate in the alternative measures.
