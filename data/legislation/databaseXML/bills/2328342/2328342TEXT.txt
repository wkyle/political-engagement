CHAPTER 47









An Act to implement the Agreement 
Establishing the World Trade 
Organization










[Assented to 15th December, 1994] 










 






Preamble


 Whereas the Government of Canada 
together with the other governments and the 
European Communities that participated in 
the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade 
Negotiations under the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (herein referred to as GATT) 
have entered into the Agreement Establishing 
the World Trade Organization;










 Whereas free, fair and open trade is 
essential for the future of the Canadian 
economy and for securing the competitiveness 
and long-term sustainable development of 
Canada;










 Whereas trade expansion contributes to job 
creation, achieves higher standards of living, 
offers greater choices for consumers and 
strengthens the Canadian economic union;










 Whereas the multilateral trading system of 
mutually agreed upon market access 
conditions and non-discriminatory trade rules 
applicable to all, is the cornerstone of 
Canadian trade policy;










 Whereas the trade agreements achieved 
under the Uruguay Round of Multilateral 
Trade Negotiations under the GATT will lead 
to a significantly more open and stable 
international trading environment for 
Canadian agriculture, resources, 
manufacturing, services, technology and 
investment;










 Whereas the World Trade Organization 
will provide for integrated management of the 
new and strengthened multilateral trading 
system, particularly for the resolution of trade 
disputes;










 Whereas the World Trade Organization, as 
successor to the GATT, will also provide the 
forum for future trade negotiations aimed at 
furthering trade liberalization world-wide and 
the development of new global trade rules;










 And whereas it is necessary, in order to 
give effect to the Agreement, to make related 
or consequential amendments to certain Acts;










Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:
