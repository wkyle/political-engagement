INCOME TAX ACT









1. (1) Subsection 6(4) of the Income Tax 
Act is replaced by the following:







Group term 
life insurance


(4) Notwithstanding any exception 
provided for in paragraph (1)(a), there shall be 
included in computing a taxpayer's income 
for a taxation year as income from an office or 
employment the premium in respect of any 
period in the year before July 1994 for any 
excess over $25,000 of the amount of life 
insurance (other than prescribed insurance) in 
effect on the taxpayer's life during that period 
under a group term life insurance policy under 
which any life insurance was effected on the 
taxpayer's life in respect of, in the course of or 
because of, the taxpayer's office or 
employment or former office or employment, 
determined as the remainder obtained by










(a) dividing that proportion of the total 
premium (other than a prescribed premium) 
payable on account of life insurance under 
the policy in respect of the policy year that 
ends in the year, minus the amount of any 
dividend or experience rating refund 
payable on account of life insurance under 
the policy in respect of the policy year, that 
the number of days in that period is of the 
number of days in the policy year, by the 
mean of the total amount of life insurance 
(other than prescribed insurance) in effect 
under the policy at the beginning of the 
policy year and the total amount of life 
insurance (other than prescribed insurance) 
so in effect at the end of the policy year,









(b) multiplying the quotient obtained under 
paragraph (a) by the excess over $25,000 of 
the amount of life insurance (other than 
prescribed insurance) in effect on the 
taxpayer's life during that period under the 
policy, and









(c) subtracting from the product obtained 
under paragraph (b) any amount that the 
taxpayer has reimbursed to the taxpayer's 
employer, or has paid, in respect of the 
amount of life insurance (other than 
prescribed insurance) in excess of $25,000 
in effect on the taxpayer's life during that 
period under the policy,









and in the case of a taxpayer on whose life any 
life insurance was in effect during any period 
in the year before July 1994 under more than 
one such group insurance policy,










(d) this subsection shall be read as requiring 
a separate determination of the amount or 
amounts, if any, to be included in 
computing the taxpayer's income for the 
year in respect of each particular policy, and









(e) the expression ``$25,000'' in this 
subsection shall be read as referring, in 
respect of a particular policy, to that 
proportion of $25,000 that the amount of 
life insurance (other than prescribed 
insurance) in effect on the taxpayer's life 
during that period under the policy is of the 
total amount of life insurance (other than 
prescribed insurance) in effect on the 
taxpayer's life during that period under all 
of the policies.









(2) Subsection 6(4) of the Act is replaced 
by the following:







Group term 
life insurance

any, prescribed for the year in respect of the
