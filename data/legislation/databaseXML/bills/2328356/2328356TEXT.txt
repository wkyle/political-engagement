CHAPTER 44









An Act respecting employment equity










[Assented to 15th December, 1995] 










Her Majesty, by and with the advice and 
consent of the Senate and House of Commons 
of Canada, enacts as follows:









SHORT TITLE






Short title


1. This Act may be cited as the Employment 
Equity Act.










PURPOSE OF ACT






Purpose of 
Act


2. The purpose of this Act is to achieve 
equality in the workplace so that no person 
shall be denied employment opportunities or 
benefits for reasons unrelated to ability and, in 
the fulfilment of that goal, to correct the 
conditions of disadvantage in employment 
experienced by women, aboriginal peoples, 
persons with disabilities and members of 
visible minorities by giving effect to the 
principle that employment equity means 
more than treating persons in the same way but 
also requires special measures and the 
accommodation of differences.

PART I









EMPLOYMENT EQUITY









Employer Obligations






Employer's 
duty


5. Every employer shall implement 
employment equity by










(a) identifying and eliminating 
employment barriers against persons in 
designated groups that result from the 
employer's employment systems, policies 
and practices that are not authorized by law; 
and









(b) instituting such positive policies and 
practices and making such reasonable 
accommodations as will ensure that persons 
in designated groups achieve a degree of 
representation in each occupational group 
in the employer's workforce that reflects 
their representation in









(i) the Canadian workforce, or









(ii) those segments of the Canadian 
workforce that are identifiable by 
qualification, eligibility or geography 
and from which the employer may 
reasonably be expected to draw 
employees.






Employer not 
required to 
take certain 
measures


6. The obligation to implement 
employment equity does not require an 
employer










(a) to take a particular measure to 
implement employment equity where the 
taking of that measure would cause undue 
hardship to the employer;









(b) to hire or promote unqualified persons;









(c) with respect to the public sector, to hire 
or promote persons without basing the 
hiring or promotion on selection according 
to merit in cases where the Public Service 
Employment Act requires that hiring or 
promotion be based on selection according 
to merit; or









(d) to create new positions in its workforce.






Employment 
of aboriginal 
peoples


7. Notwithstanding any other provision of 
this Act, where a private sector employer is 
engaged primarily in promoting or serving the 
interests of aboriginal peoples, the employer 
may give preference in employment to 
aboriginal peoples or employ only aboriginal 
peoples, unless that preference or 
employment would constitute a 
discriminatory practice under the Canadian 
Human Rights Act.







Certain rights 
not 
employment 
barriers


8. (1) Employee seniority rights with 
respect to a layoff or recall under a collective 
agreement or pursuant to the established 
practices of an employer are deemed not to be 
employment barriers within the meaning of 
this Act.







Other 
seniority 
rights


(2) Unless they are found to constitute a 
discriminatory practice under the Canadian 
Human Rights Act, employee seniority rights 
other than those referred to in subsection (1), 
including rights acquired under workforce 
adjustment policies implemented when an 
employer is downsizing or restructuring, 
under a collective agreement or pursuant to an 
established practice, are deemed not to be 
employment barriers within the meaning of 
this Act.










 









 









 






Adverse 
impact on 
employment 
opportunities


(3) Notwithstanding subsections (1) and 
(2), where, after a review under paragraph 
9(1)(b), it appears that a right referred to in 
either of those subsections that is provided for 
under a collective agreement may have an 
adverse impact on the employment 
opportunities of persons in designated groups, 
the employer and its employees' 
representatives shall consult with each other 
concerning measures that may be taken to 
minimize the adverse impact.







Public sector


(4) The following are not, in relation to the 
public sector, employment barriers within the 
meaning of the Act, namely,










(a) priorities for appointment under the 
Public Service Employment Act or 
regulations made by the Public Service 
Commission; and









(b) workforce adjustment measures 
established by the Treasury Board, 
including measures set out in the Workforce 
Adjustment Directive, or by the Public 
Service Commission or any other portion of 
the public sector referred to in paragraphs 
4(1)(c) and (d).






Analysis and 
review


9. (1) For the purpose of implementing 
employment equity, every employer shall










(a) collect information and conduct an 
analysis of the employer's workforce, in 
accordance with the regulations, in order to 
determine the degree of the 
underrepresentation of persons in 
designated groups in each occupational 
group in that workforce; and









(b) conduct a review of the employer's 
employment systems, policies and 
practices, in accordance with the 
regulations, in order to identify 
employment barriers against persons in 
designated groups that result from those 
systems, policies and practices.






Self- 
identification


(2) Only those employees who identify 
themselves to an employer, or agree to be 
identified by an employer, as aboriginal 
peoples, members of visible minorities or 
persons with disabilities are to be counted as 
members of those designated groups for the 
purposes of implementing 
employment equity.







Confidentialit
y of 
information


(3) Information collected by an employer 
under paragraph (1)(a) is confidential and 
shall be used only for the purpose of 
implementing the employer's obligations 
under this Act.







Employment 
equity plan


10. (1) The employer shall prepare an 
employment equity plan that










(a) specifies the positive policies and 
practices that are to be instituted by the 
employer in the short term for the hiring, 
training, promotion and retention of 
persons in designated groups and for the 
making of reasonable accommodations for 
those persons, to correct the 
underrepresentation of those persons 
identified by the analysis under paragraph 
9(1)(a);









(b) specifies the measures to be taken by the 
employer in the short term for the 
elimination of any employment barriers 
identified by the review under paragraph 
9(1)(b);









(c) establishes a timetable for the 
implementation of the matters referred to in 
paragraphs (a) and (b);









(d) where underrepresentation has been 
identified by the analysis, establishes short 
term numerical goals for the hiring and 
promotion of persons in designated groups 
in order to increase their representation in 
each occupational group in the workforce in 
which underrepresentation has been 
identified and sets out measures to be taken 
in each year to meet those goals;









(e) sets out the employer's longer term 
goals for increasing the representation of 
persons in designated groups in the 
employer's workforce and the employer's 
strategy for achieving those goals; and

of numerical 
goals
