available for work during any period in which  










(a) the claimant is attending a course or 
program of instruction or training, or other 
courses or programs designed to facilitate

(2) The benefit period of a claimant that is 
current when the claimant begins attendance 
at a course or program to which the claimant 
has been referred or is established while the 
claimant is attending that course or program 
under paragraph (1)(a) or when the claimant 
begins attendance at an accredited university 
under paragraph (1)(b)  and that would 
otherwise terminate may, as prescribed, be 
extended to the end of the week that is not 
more than six weeks after the week in which 
the claimant completes the course, the 
program or the university year,  or leaves the 
course, the program or the accredited 
university  with cause.







Idem


(3) Notwithstanding any provision of this 
Part limiting the number of weeks for which 
benefit is payable in a benefit period, benefit 
may, unless otherwise prescribed, be paid for 
each week of unemployment that falls in any 
extension of a benefit period under 
subsection (2).

benefit


(4) Notwithstanding section 13, the rates of 
weekly benefit payable to claimants who are 
attending courses or programs to which they 
have been referred under paragraph (1)(a) or 
who are in attendance at an accredited

prescribed amounts not exceeding the greater 
of the rates payable under that section and the 
rates payable under the National Training Act.

(5) Notwithstanding subsection 9(9) and 
subsection (2), the length of any benefit period 
under subsection (2) shall not exceed one 
hundred and fifty-six weeks.







Presumption


(6) For the purposes of this Part, benefit 
may, as prescribed, be deemed to be paid for

allowance in respect of attendance at a course 
or program mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) or 
at an accredited university mentioned in 
paragraph (1)(b) .







Deduction

where earnings or allowances are payable to a 
claimant for or in respect of a week during 
which the claimant is attending a course or 
program mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) or an 
accredited university mentioned in paragraph 
(1)(b) , an amount not exceeding those 
earnings or allowances may, as prescribed, be 
deducted from any benefit payable to the 
claimant in respect of that week.

(8) No decision referring or refusing to refer 
a claimant to a course or program mentioned 
in subsection (1) is subject to appeal under 
section 79 or 80.
