42-43 Elizabeth II, 1994










The House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-288









An Act to revoke the conviction of Louis 
David Riel










 






Preamble


 Whereas Louis David Riel, Member of the 
House of Commons for the electoral district of 
Provencher from 1873 to 1874, was convicted 
on August 1, 1885 of high treason, sentenced 
to death, and was hanged on November 16, 
1885 at Regina, North West Territories;










 And whereas, notwithstanding his 
conviction, Louis David Riel has become a 
symbol and a hero to successive generations of 
Canadians who have, through their 
governments, honoured and commemorated 
him in specific projects and actions;










 And whereas it is consistent with this 
recognition that the conviction of Louis David 
Riel be now revoked;










Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:







Revocation of 
conviction


1. The conviction of Louis David Riel for 
the offence of high treason is hereby revoked.







Saving 
provision


2. Nothing in this Act shall be construed as 
limiting or reflecting in any manner Her 
Majesty's royal prerogative of mercy or the 
Letters Patent Constituting the Office of 
Governor General of Canada relating to 
pardons.
