The House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-303









An Act to amend the Criminal Code 
(dangerous intoxication)


















Preamble


 Whereas societal mores should be 
reflected in the administration of justice in 
Canada;










 Whereas a person shall not be excused 
from personal liability based on a defence that 
he or she was in a state of extreme intoxication 
akin to automatism or insanity by cause of 
self-induced impairment;










 Whereas Parliament of Canada considers 
that the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms should not be pleaded to exempt a 
person from personal liability in such a case;










 Whereas the public interest requires that 
intoxicated violence be dealt with and 
punished as a separate offence;
