1nd Session, 35th Parliament,
42-43-44 Elizabeth II, 1994-95










The House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-311









An Act to require the Minister for 
International Trade to retaliate against 
import restrictions introduced by the 
United States of America on Canadian 
refined sugar and sugar-containing 
products










 Whereas the Government of Canada and 
the governments of other countries entered 
into agreements to establish the World Trade 
Organization (WTO) effective January 1, 
1995;










 Whereas as part of the WTO negotiations 
members of the World Trade Organization 
were required to make binding market access 
concessions on agricultural trade pursuant to 
the WTO Agreement on Agriculture;










 Whereas the Government of the United 
States of America took the opportunity to 
impose additional restrictions on imports of 
Canadian refined sugar and sugar-containing 
products;










 Whereas such restrictions were added to 
numbers of existing import restrictions and 
will substantially reduce market access for 
Canadian refined sugar and sugar-containing 
products;










 Whereas such action was unreasonable and 
inconsistent with international trade rules;










 Whereas such action will burden and 
restrict fairly traded Canadian sugar products;










 And whereas it is necessary to take action 
on an urgent basis to protect the interest of 
Canadian producers of sugarbeets, refined 
sugar and sugar-containing products;










Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and the 
House of Commons of Canada, enacts as 
follows:

PART I









3. The Minister shall undertake 
consultations with the Government of the 
United States of America to determine 
whether it will restore the previous levels of 
access which Canadian exports of sugar and 
sugar-containing products held prior to the 
imposition of new restrictions in the United 
States of America's schedule of market access 
commitments made pursuant to the WTO 
Agreement on Agriculture. Such 
consultations shall be concluded within 60 
days of the entry into force of this Act.










4. In the event that consultations pursuant to 
section 3 fail to restore access levels within the 
60 day period, the Governor in Council shall 
take immediate action under section 59 of the 
Customs Tariff necessary to protect the 
interests of Canadian producers of sugarbeets, 
refined sugar and sugar-containing products. 
Such action shall suspend concessions or 
benefits related to imports of the like products 
from the United States of America. Canadian 
imports of refined sugar and sugar-containing 
products from the United States of America 
shall be limited to the equivalent market share 
(percentage share of total Canadian market for 
such products) that Canadian exports of 
refined sugar and sugar-containing products 
hold of the United States market (percentage 
share of total U.S. market for such products).

the end of every 90 day period commencing 
after the entry into force of this Act on 
whether, in the opinion of the Minister, there 
has been a satisfactory resolution of the 
matter. Retaliatory measures maintained 
pursuant to section 4 shall be removed upon 
the date which the Minister specifies in the 
report to Parliament made under this section.
