AMENDMENT TO THE COLLECTIVE AGREEMENT









10. Nothing in this Act shall be construed so 
as to limit or restrict the rights of the parties to 
the collective agreement to agree to amend 
any provision of the agreement as amended by 
or pursuant to this Act and to give effect 
thereto.










ENFORCEMENT









11. (1) An individual who contravenes any 
provision of this Act is guilty of an offence 
punishable on summary conviction and is 
liable, for each day and part of a day during 
which the offence continues, to a fine










(a) of not more than $50,000, where the 
individual was acting in the capacity of an 
officer or representative of the employer or 
the union when the offence was committed; 
or









(b) of not more than $1,000, in any other 
case.









(2) Where the employer or the union 
contravenes any provision of this Act, it is 
guilty of an offence punishable on summary 
conviction and is liable, for each day or part of 
a day during which the offence continues, to 
a fine of not more than $100,000.










12. Notwithstanding subsection 787(2) of 
the Criminal Code, a term of imprisonment 
may not be imposed in default of payment of 
a fine that is imposed under section 11.










13. Where a person is convicted of an 
offence under section 11 and the fine that is 
imposed is not paid when required, the 
prosecutor may, by filing the conviction, enter 
as a judgement the amount of the fine and 
costs, if any, in a superior court of the province 
in which the trial was held, and the judgement 
is enforceable against the person in the same 
manner as if it were a judgement rendered 
against the person in that court in civil 
proceedings.










14. For the purposes of this Act, the 
employer and the union are deemed to be 
persons.










15. For greater certainty, nothing in this Act 
shall be construed so as to restrict a person 
from raising a defence of due diligence in a 
prosecution for an offence under section 11.










COMING INTO FORCE









16. This Act shall come into force on the 
day immediately following the day it is 
assented to.
