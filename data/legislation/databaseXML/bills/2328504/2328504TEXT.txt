the coming into force of this Act, the employer 
and the union may provide the Minister with 
the name of a person that they jointly 
recommend be appointed arbitrator for the 
purpose of final offer selection.










(2) The Minister shall, as soon as 
practicable, appoint the person recommended

recommended under subsection (1) within the 
period referred to in that subsection, the 
Minister shall, as soon as practicable, appoint 
as arbitrator for final offer selection such 
person as the Minister considers appropriate.










4. (1) Within such time and in such manner 
as the arbitrator may specify, the employer 
and the union shall each submit to the 
arbitrator










(a) a list of the matters on which the 
employer and the union were in agreement 
at cut-off time and proposed contractual 
language that would give effect to those 
matters;









(b) a list of the matters remaining in dispute 
at cut-off time; and









(c) a final offer in respect of the matters 
referred to in paragraph (b).









(2) The final offer referred to in paragraph 
(1)(c) must be submitted with proposed 
contractual language that can be incorporated 
into the new collective agreement.










5. (1) Within thirty days after being 
appointed, or within such greater period as 
may be specified by the Minister, the 
arbitrator shall










(a) determine the matters on which the 
employer and the union were in agreement 
at cut-off time;

by the other party.










(3) The arbitrator's decision, excluding the 
back-to-work protocol, shall be drafted in 
such manner as to constitute a new collective 
agreement between the employer and the 
union and, to the extent that it is possible, 
incorporate the contractual language referred 
to in paragraph 4(1)(a) and the final offer 
selected by the arbitrator.










6. (1) The arbitrator's decision constitutes a 
new collective agreement between the 
employer and the union effective as of the day 
it is made until such date as determined by the 
arbitrator, notwithstanding anything in Part I 
of the Canada Labour Code, and Part I of that 
Act applies in respect of the collective 
agreement as if it had been entered into 
pursuant to that Part.










(2) The new collective agreement may 
provide that any term or condition thereof is 
effective and binding on a day before or after 
the new collective agreement becomes 
effective.










7. The arbitrator has, with such 
modifications as the circumstances require, 
all the powers and duties of an arbitrator 
pursuant to sections 60 and 61 of the Canada 
Labour Code.










8. (a) Once the arbitrator has reported to the 
Minister, the employer shall forthwith resume 
or continue operations in accordance with the 
terms of the arbitrator; and










(b) every employee, as determined by the 
arbitrator pursuant to section 3, shall, when 
required to do so, return to work forthwith 
in accordance with the terms of the 
arbitrator.









OBLIGATIONS









9. Neither the employer nor any officer or 
representative of the employer shall










(a) in any manner impede any employee 
from complying with paragraph 8(b);

discipline, or authorize or direct the 
discharge or discipline of, any employee by 
reason of that employee's having been on 
strike before the coming into force of this 
Act.









10. The union and each officer and 
representatives of the union shall










(a) forthwith once the arbitrator has 
reported to the Minister, give notice to the 
employees that, by reason of that reporting, 
the operations at the ADM Agri-Industries 
Ltd., Montreal, Quebec are to be resumed 
and that the employees, when required to do 
so, are forthwith to resume the duties of 
their employment;









(b) take all reasonable steps to ensure that 
employees comply with paragraph 8(b);









(c) refrain from any conduct that may 
encourage employees not to comply with 
paragraph 8(b).









11. All costs incurred by Her Majesty in

to Her Majesty in right of Canada and may be 
recovered as such, in equal parts, from the 
employer and the union in any court of 
competent jurisdiction.










AMENDMENT TO THE COLLECTIVE AGREEMENT









12. Nothing in this Act shall be construed so 
as to limit or restrict the rights of the parties to 
the collective agreement to agree to amend 
any provision of the agreement as amended by 
or pursuant to this Act and to give effect 
thereto.










ENFORCEMENT









13. (1) An individual who contravenes any 
provision of this Act is guilty of an offence 
punishable on summary conviction and is 
liable, for each day and part of a day during 
which the offence continues, to a fine










(a) of not more than $50,000, where the 
individual was acting in the capacity of an 
officer or representative of the employer or 
the union when the offence was committed; 
or









(b) of not more than $1,000, in any other 
case.









(2) Where the employer or the union 
contravenes any provision of this Act, it is 
guilty of an offence punishable on summary 
conviction and is liable, for each day or part of 
a day during which the offence continues, to 
a fine of not more than $100,000.










14. Notwithstanding subsection 787(2) of 
the Criminal Code, a term of imprisonment 
may not be imposed in default of payment of 
a fine that is imposed under section 13.










15. Where a person is convicted of an 
offence under section 13 and the fine that is 
imposed is not paid when required, the 
prosecutor may, by filing the conviction, enter 
as a judgement the amount of the fine and 
costs, if any, in a superior court of the province 
in which the trial was held, and the judgement 
is enforceable against the person in the same 
manner as if it were a judgement rendered 
against the person in that court in civil 
proceedings.










16. For the purposes of this Act, the 
employer and the union are deemed to be 
persons.










17. For greater certainty, nothing in this Act 
shall be construed so as to restrict a person 
from raising a defence of due diligence in a 
prosecution for an offence under section 13.

immediately following the day it is assented 
to.
