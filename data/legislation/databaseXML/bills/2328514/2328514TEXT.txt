NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION POLICY






Declaration


5. It is hereby declared that a safe, 
economic, efficient and adequate network of 
viable and effective transportation services 
accessible to persons with disabilities and that 
makes the best use of all available modes of 
transportation at the lowest total cost is 
essential to serve the transportation needs of 
shippers and travellers, including persons with 
disabilities, and to maintain the economic 
well-being and growth of Canada and its 
regions and that those objectives are most 
likely to be achieved when all carriers are able 
to compete, both within and among the 
various modes of transportation, under 
conditions ensuring that, having due regard to 
national policy, to the advantages of 
harmonized federal and provincial regulatory 
approaches and to legal and constitutional 
requirements,










(a) the national transportation system meets 
the highest practicable safety standards,









(b) competition and market forces are, 
whenever possible, the prime agents in 
providing viable and effective 
transportation services,









(c) economic regulation of carriers and 
modes of transportation occurs only in 
respect of those services and regions where 
regulation is necessary to serve the 
transportation needs of shippers and 
travellers and that such regulation will not 
unfairly limit the ability of any carrier or 
mode of transportation to compete freely 
with any other carrier or mode of 
transportation,









(d) transportation is recognized as a key to 
regional economic development and that 
commercial viability of transportation links 
is balanced with regional economic 
development objectives so that the 
potential economic strengths of each region 
may be realized,









(e) each carrier or mode of transportation, 
as far as is practicable, bears a fair 
proportion of the real costs of the resources, 
facilities and services provided to that 
carrier or mode of transportation at public 
expense,









(f) each carrier or mode of transportation, as 
far as is practicable, receives fair and 
reasonable compensation for the resources, 
facilities and services that it is required to 
provide as an imposed public duty,









(g) each carrier or mode of transportation, 
as far as is practicable, carries traffic to or 
from any point in Canada under fares, rates 
and conditions that do not constitute









(i) an unfair disadvantage in respect of 
any such traffic beyond the disadvantage 
inherent in the location or volume of the 
traffic, the scale of operation connected 
with the traffic or the type of traffic or 
service involved,









(ii) an undue obstacle to the mobility of 
persons, including persons with 
disabilities,









(iii) an undue obstacle to the interchange 
of commodities between points in 
Canada, or









(iv) an unreasonable discouragement to 
the development of primary or secondary 
industries, to export trade in or from any 
region of Canada or to the movement of 
commodities through Canadian ports, 
and









(h) each mode of transportation is 
economically viable,









and this Act is enacted in accordance with and 
for the attainment of those objectives to the 
extent that they fall within the purview of 
subject-matters under the legislative authority 
of Parliament relating to transportation.
