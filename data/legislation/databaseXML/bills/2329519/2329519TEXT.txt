Child support 
order

may, on application by either or both spouses, 
make an order requiring a spouse to pay for the 
support of any or all children of the marriage.







Interim order


(2) Where an application is made under 
subsection (1), the court may, on application 
by either or both spouses, make an interim 
order requiring a spouse to pay for the support 
of any or all children of the marriage, pending 
the determination of the application under

Guidelines 
apply


(3) A court making an order under 
subsection (1) or an interim order under 
subsection (2) shall do so in accordance with 
the applicable guidelines.







Terms and 
conditions


(4) The court may make an order under 
subsection (1) or an interim order under 
subsection (2) for a definite or indefinite 
period or until a specified event occurs, and 
may impose terms, conditions or restrictions 
in connection with the order or interim order 
as it thinks fit and just.







Court may 
take 
agreement, 
etc., into 
account


(5) Notwithstanding subsection (3), a court 
may award an amount that is different from the 
amount that would be determined in 
accordance with the applicable guidelines if 
the court is satisfied










(a) that special provisions in an order, a 
judgment or a written agreement respecting 
the financial obligations of the spouses, or 
the division or transfer of their property, 
directly or indirectly benefit a child, or that 
special provisions have otherwise been 
made for the benefit of a child; and









(b) that the application of the applicable 
guidelines would result in an amount of 
child support that is inequitable given those 
special provisions.






Reasons


(6) Where the court awards, pursuant to 
subsection (5), an amount that is different 
from the amount that would be determined in 
accordance with the applicable guidelines, the 
court shall record its reasons for having done 
so.







Consent 
orders


(7) Notwithstanding subsection (3), a court 
may award an amount that is different from the 
amount that would be determined in 
accordance with the applicable guidelines on 
the consent of both spouses if it is satisfied that 
reasonable arrangements have been made for 
the support of the child to whom the order 
relates.







Reasonable 
arrangements


(8) For the purposes of subsection (7), in 
determining whether reasonable 
arrangements have been made for the support 
of a child, the court shall have regard to the 
applicable guidelines. However, the court 
shall not consider the arrangements to be 
unreasonable solely because the amount of 
support agreed to is not the same as the amount 
that would otherwise have been determined in 
accordance with the applicable guidelines.










Spousal Support Orders






Spousal 
support order


15.2 (1) A court of competent jurisdiction 
may, on application by either or both spouses, 
make an order requiring a spouse to secure or

periodic sums, or such lump sum and periodic 
sums, as the court thinks reasonable for the 
support of the other spouse.

(2) Where an application is made under 
subsection (1), the court may, on application 
by either or both spouses, make an interim 
order requiring a spouse to secure or pay, or to 
secure and pay, such lump sum or periodic 
sums, or such lump sum and periodic sums, as 
the court thinks reasonable for the support of 
the other spouse, pending the determination of 
the application under subsection (1).







Terms and 
conditions


(3) The court may make an order under 
subsection (1) or an interim order under 
subsection (2) for a definite or indefinite 
period or until a specified event occurs, and 
may impose terms, conditions or restrictions 
in connection with the order as it thinks fit and 
just.







Factors


(4) In making an order under subsection (1) 
or an interim order under subsection (2), the 
court shall take into consideration the 
condition, means, needs and other 
circumstances of each spouse, including










(a) the length of time the spouses cohabited;









(b) the functions performed by each spouse 
during cohabitation; and









(c) any order, agreement or arrangement 
relating to support of either spouse.






Spousal 
misconduct


(5) In making an order under subsection (1) 
or an interim order under subsection (2), the 
court shall not take into consideration any 
misconduct of a spouse in relation to the 
marriage.







Objectives of 
spousal 
support order


(6) An order made under subsection (1) or 
an interim order under subsection (2) that 
provides for the support of a spouse should










(a) recognize any economic advantages or 
disadvantages to the spouses arising from 
the marriage or its breakdown;









(b) apportion between the spouses any 
financial consequences arising from the 
care of any child of the marriage over and 
above any obligation for the support of any 
child of the marriage;









(c) relieve any economic hardship of the 
spouses arising from the breakdown of the 
marriage; and









(d) in so far as practicable, promote the 
economic self-sufficiency of each spouse 
within a reasonable period of time.









Priority






Priority to 
child support


15.3 (1) Where a court is considering an 
application for a child support order and an 
application for a spousal support order, the 
court shall give priority to child support in 
determining the applications.







Reasons


(2) Where, as a result of giving priority to 
child support, the court is unable to make a 
spousal support order or the court makes a 
spousal support order in an amount that is less 
than it otherwise would have been, the court 
shall record its reasons for having done so.







Consequences 
of reduction 
or termination 
of child 
support order


(3) Where, as a result of giving priority to 
child support, a spousal support order was not 
made, or the amount of a spousal support order 
is less than it otherwise would have been, any 
subsequent reduction or termination of that 
child support constitutes a change of 
circumstances for the purposes of applying for 
a spousal support order, or a variation order in 
respect of the spousal support order, as the 
case may be.

following before section 16:

order

in respect of a child support order, the court 
shall satisfy itself that a change of 
circumstances as provided for in the 
applicable guidelines has occurred since the 
making of the child support order or the last 
variation order made in respect of that order.







Factors for 
spousal 
support order


(4.1) Before the court makes a variation 
order in respect of a spousal support order, the 
court shall satisfy itself that a change in the 
condition, means, needs or other 
circumstances of either former spouse has 
occurred since the making of the spousal 
support order or the last variation order made 
in respect of that order, and, in making the 
variation order, the court shall take that 
change into consideration.










(2) Section 17 of the Act is amended by 
adding the following after subsection (6):







Guidelines 
apply


(6.1) A court making a variation order in 
respect of a child support order shall do so in

agreement, 
etc., into 
account


(6.2) Notwithstanding subsection (6.1), in 
making a variation order in respect of a child 
support order, a court may award an amount 
that is different from the amount that would be 
determined in accordance with the applicable 
guidelines if the court is satisfied










(a) that special provisions in an order, a 
judgment or a written agreement respecting 
the financial obligations of the spouses, or 
the division or transfer of their property, 
directly or indirectly benefit a child, or that 
special provisions have otherwise been 
made for the benefit of a child; and









(b) that the application of the applicable 
guidelines would result in an amount of 
child support that is inequitable given those 
special provisions.






Reasons


(6.3) Where the court awards, pursuant to 
subsection (6.2), an amount that is different 
from the amount that would be determined in 
accordance with the applicable guidelines, the 
court shall record its reasons for having done 
so.







Consent 
orders


(6.4) Notwithstanding subsection (6.1), a 
court may award an amount that is different 
from the amount that would be determined in 
accordance with the applicable guidelines on 
the consent of both spouses if it is satisfied that 
reasonable arrangements have been made for 
the support of the child to whom the order 
relates.







Reasonable 
arrangements


(6.5) For the purposes of subsection (6.4), in 
determining whether reasonable 
arrangements have been made for the support 
of a child, the court shall have regard to the 
applicable guidelines. However, the court 
shall not consider the arrangements to be 
unreasonable solely because the amount of 
support agreed to is not the same as the amount 
that would otherwise have been determined in 
accordance with the applicable guidelines.

for a definite period or until a specified event 
occurs, a court may not, on an application 
instituted after the expiration of that period or 
the occurrence of the event, make a variation 
order for the purpose of resuming that support 
unless the court is satisfied that










(a) a variation order is necessary to relieve 
economic hardship arising from a change 
described in subsection (4.1) that is related 
to the marriage; and









(b) the changed circumstances, had they 
existed at the time of the making of the 
spousal support order or the last variation 
order made in respect of that order, as the 
case may be, would likely have resulted in 
a different order.
