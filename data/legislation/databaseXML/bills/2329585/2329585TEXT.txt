The House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-65









An Act respecting the protection of wildlife 
species in Canada from extirpation or 
extinction







Preamble


Recognizing that










Canada's natural heritage is an integral part 
of our national identity and history,









wildlife, in all its forms, has value in and of 
itself and is valued by Canadians for 
aesthetic, cultural, spiritual, recreational, 
educational, historical, economic, medical, 
ecological and scientific reasons,









Canadian wildlife species and ecosystems 
are also part of the world's heritage and the 
Government of Canada has ratified the 
United Nations Convention on the 
Conservation of Biological Diversity,









providing legal protection for wildlife 
species at risk will in part meet Canada's 
commitments under that Convention,









the Government of Canada is committed to 
conserving biological diversity and to the 
principle that, if there are threats of serious 
or irreversible damage to wildlife species, 
cost effective measures to prevent the 
reduction or loss of the species should not 
be postponed for a lack of scientific 
certainty,









responsibility for the conservation of 
wildlife in Canada is shared among the 
various levels of government in this country 
and it is important for them  to work 
together to pursue the establishment of 
complementary legislation and programs 
for the protection and the recovery of 
species at risk in Canada ,









all Canadians have a role to play in the 
conservation of wildlife in this country, 
including the prevention of wildlife species 
from becoming extirpated or extinct,









the conservation efforts of individual 
Canadians and communities should be 
encouraged and supported and their 
interests should be considered in 
developing and implementing recovery 
measures,  









the role of the aboriginal people in  Canada, 
and of the wildlife management boards 
established under aboriginal land claims 
legislation,  in the conservation of wildlife 
in this country, are especially important, 
and









knowledge of wildlife species and 
ecosystems is critical to their conservation,









Her Majesty, by and with the advice and 
consent of the Senate and House of Commons 
of Canada, enacts as follows:
