this Act is to contribute to sustainable devel
opment through pollution prevention.







Preamble


 Whereas the Government of Canada seeks 
to achieve sustainable development that is 
based on an ecologically efficient use of natu
ral, social and economic resources and ac
knowledges the need to integrate environmen
tal, economic and social factors in the making 
of all decisions by government and private en
tities;










 Whereas the Government of Canada is 
committed to implementing pollution preven
tion as a national goal and as the priority ap

 Whereas the Government of Canada recog
nizes the importance of an ecosystem ap
proach;










 Whereas the Government of Canada will 
continue to demonstrate national leadership in 
establishing ecosystem objectives and envi
ronmental quality guidelines and codes of 
practice;










 Whereas the Government of Canada is 
committed to implementing the precautionary 
principle such that, where there are threats of 
serious or irreversible damage, lack of scien
tific certainty shall not be used as a reason for 
postponing cost-effective measures to prevent 
environmental degradation;










 Whereas the Government of Canada recog
nizes the importance of endeavouring, in 
cooperation with provinces, territories and ab
original peoples, to achieve the highest level 
of environmental quality for all Canadians 
and ultimately contribute to sustainable devel
opment;










 Whereas the Government of Canada recog
nizes that the risk of toxic substances in the en

within geographic boundaries;










 Whereas the Government of Canada recog
nizes the integral role of science in the process 
of making decisions relating to the protection 
of the environment and human health;










 Whereas the Government of Canada recog
nizes the responsibility of users and producers

and wastes, and has adopted the ``polluter 
pays'' principle;










 Whereas the Government of Canada is 
committed to ensuring that its operations and 
activities on federal and aboriginal lands are 
carried out in a manner that is consistent with 
the principles of pollution prevention and the 
protection of the environment and human 
health;










 Whereas the Government of Canada will 
endeavour to remove threats to biological di
versity through pollution prevention and the 
control and management of toxic substances;










 And whereas the Government of Canada 
must be able to fulfil its international obliga
tions in respect of the environment;










Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of
