45-46 Elizabeth II, 1996-97










The House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-95









An Act to amend the Criminal Code (criminal 
organizations) and to amend other Acts 
in consequence







Preamble


 Whereas the use of violence by organized 
criminal gangs has resulted in death or injury 
to several persons, including innocent 
bystanders, and in serious damage to property;










 Whereas Canadians who have witnessed 
the extent and the indiscriminate nature of that 
violence demand that means be taken to bring 
that violence and destruction to an end;










 Whereas the Parliament of Canada 
acknowledges the calls from those responsible 
for the administration of criminal justice to 
provide better means to deal with gang-related 
violence and crime;










 Whereas the Parliament of Canada 
recognizes that the criminal activities of 
criminal organizations pose a threat to public 
order and to the safety of individual 
Canadians;










 Whereas the Parliament of Canada 
recognizes that criminal organizations exist in 
great part for the purpose of carrying out 
criminal activities aimed at acquiring 
property;










 Whereas the Parliament of Canada 
recognizes the importance of depriving 
criminal organizations and their members of 
the proceeds of their criminal activities and of 
the means used to carry out those activities;










 Whereas the Parliament of Canada 
recognizes the importance of deterring those 
criminal organizations and their members 
from resorting to violence to further their 
criminal objects;










 Whereas the Parliament of Canada 
recognizes the need to provide law 
enforcement officials with effective measures 
to prevent and deter the commission of 
criminal activity by criminal organizations 
and their members, to investigate and 
prosecute such activity and to forfeit the 
proceeds of such criminal activity;










 And whereas the Parliament of Canada 
recognizes that the measures provided for 
must be consistent with the principles set out 
and the rights guaranteed in the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms;










Now Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:
