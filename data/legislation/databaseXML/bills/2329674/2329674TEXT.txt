45-46 Elizabeth II, 1996-97










The House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-









An Act to amend the Canada Evidence Act 
and the Criminal Code in respect of 
persons with disabilities, to amend the 
Canadian Human Rights Act in respect of 
persons with disabilities and other 
matters and to make consequential 
amendments to other Acts







Preamble


 Whereas the Parliament of Canada affirms 
the dignity and worth of all individuals and 
seeks to strengthen their right to make for 
themselves the kind of life they wish to have 
through the removal of barriers to their full 
participation in society;










 Whereas for individuals and groups that are 
disadvantaged identical treatment does not 
always lead to equality, and positive measures 
to remove discriminatory barriers may be 
necessary to help to ensure equality and to 
enable members of all groups to participate 
equally in the workplace and in access to 
goods, services, facilities and 
accommodation;










 Whereas accommodating the needs of 
persons with disabilities is particularly 
important to ensure that they can be full 
participants in and contributors to Canadian 
society;










 And Whereas the Parliament of Canada is 
committed to ensuring equal access to the 
criminal justice system for persons with 
disabilities;










NOW, THEREFORE, Her Majesty, by and 
with the advice and consent of the Senate and 
House of Commons of Canada, enacts as 
follows:
