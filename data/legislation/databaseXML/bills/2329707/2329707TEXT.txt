2nd Session, 35th Parliament,
45 Elizabeth II, 1996-97










The House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-254









An Act to amend the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act and the 
Criminal Code










 






Preamble


 Whereas the Parliament of Canada is 
gravely concerned about the incidence of 
offenders repeating violent offences, 
particularly sexual offences, and the effects on 
Canadian society;










 Whereas the Parliament of Canada 
recognizes that a small number of high-risk 
offenders may be identified after sentencing 
as posing a clear, continuing and substantial 
threat of harm to the physical or mental 
well-being of other persons;










 Whereas the Parliament of Canada 
recognizes that measures of varying degrees 
of restriction are required to prevent the 
repetition of violent offences and the 
associated harm and believes that highly 
restrictive measures may legitimately be used 
in exceptional and carefully defined 
circumstances;










 Whereas the Parliament of Canada 
acknowledges that in cases of sexual offences 
involving children evidence of serious harm 
may not be available for a variety of reasons, 
including the victims' inability, because of 
their youth, to describe the injury caused by 
the offence and the fact that indications of 
serious harm may only appear years after the 
offence is committed;










 And Whereas the Parliament of Canada 
recognizes that the required measures must be 
implemented in a manner consistent with the 
rights and freedoms guaranteed under the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms;










 Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with 
the advice and consent of the Senate and 
House of Commons of Canada, enacts as 
follows:










 






1992, c. 20; 
1993, c 34
