the province or Canada to be set as a 
condition of eligibility for social assistance 
or for the receipt or continued receipt 
thereof;









(b) make or allow the amount, form or 
manner of social assistance to be contingent 
upon a period of such residence; or  









(c) have been declared unconstitutional by 
the Supreme Court of Canada during the 
last fiscal year on the grounds that they 
infringe the rights and freedoms guaranteed 
to the French linguistic minority of the 
province by subsection 16(2), section 16.1, 
subsections 17(2) or 18(2), section 19, 
subsection 20(2) or section 23 of the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 









2. (1) Subsections 21(1) and (2) of the Act 
are replaced by the following:







Order 
reducing or 
withholding 
contribution


21. (1) Where, on the referral of a matter 
under section 20, the Governor in Council is 
of the opinion that the province does not or has 
ceased to comply with paragraph 19(1)(a) or 
(b) , the Governor in Council may, by order,










(a) direct that any cash contribution to that 
province for a fiscal year be reduced, in 
respect of each non-compliance, by an 
amount that the Governor in Council 
considers to be appropriate, having regard 
to the gravity of the non-compliance; or









(b) where the Governor in Council 
considers it appropriate, direct that the 
whole of any cash contribution to that 
province for a fiscal year be withheld.






Order 
reducing and 
paying 
contribution


(1.1) Where, on the referral of a matter 
under section 20, the Governor in Council is 
of the opinion that the province does not or has

Governor in Council shall, by order, direct that 
any cash contribution to that province for a 
fiscal year be reduced by an amount that the 
Governor in Council considers to be 
appropriate, having regard to the gravity of the 
non-compliance, and that the amount be paid 
to institutions or agencies in the province that, 
in the opinion of the Minister, are dedicated to 
the protection or promotion of the use of 
French in the province or that will be able to 
offer social programs in French for all or part 
of the French linguistic minority in the 
province.  







Amending 
orders


(2) The Governor in Council may, by order, 
repeal or amend any order made under
