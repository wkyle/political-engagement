2nd Session, 35th Parliament,
45-46 Elizabeth II, 1996-97










The House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-388









An act to establish a Canadian Charter of 
Duties and Responsibilities







Preamble


 Whereas the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms recognizes certain rights and 
freedoms for every person;










 Whereas it is impossible for a civilized 
society to exist unless the citizens of that 
society recognize that their rights and 
freedoms are dependent upon the fulfilment of 
their duties and responsibilities;










 And Whereas the existence of these facts 
justifies the establishment of a Charter of 
Canadian's duties and responsibilities toward 
Canada and toward Canadian society;










Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:
