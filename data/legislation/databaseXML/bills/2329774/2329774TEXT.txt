Her Majesty, by and with the advice and

Income Tax Act are replaced by the 
following:







Interpreta-
tion of 
``business 
limit''


(2) For the purposes of this section, a 
corporation's ``business limit'' for a taxation 
year prior to 1997  is $200,000 and is $300,000 
for the 1997 or subsequent taxation years,  
unless the corporation is associated in the year 
with one or more other Canadian-controlled 
private corporations in which case, except as 
otherwise provided in this section, its business 
limit for the year is nil.







Associated 
corporations


(3) Notwithstanding subsection (2), if all of 
the Canadian-controlled private corporations 
that are associated with each other in a 
taxation year have filed with the Minister in 
prescribed form an agreement whereby, for 
the purposes of this section, they allocate an 
amount to one or more of them for the taxation 
year and the amount so allocated or the total 
of the amounts so allocated, as the case may 
be, is $200,000 in respect of a taxation year 
prior to 1997 or $300,000 in respect of the 
1997 or subsequent taxation years , the 
business limit for the year of each of the 
corporations is the amount so allocated to it.







Failure to file 
agreement


(4) If any of the Canadian-controlled 
private corporations that are associated with 
each other in a taxation year has failed to file 
with the Minister an agreement as 
contemplated by subsection (3) within 30 days 
after notice in writing by the Minister has been 
forwarded to any of them that such an 
agreement is required for the purposes of any 
assessment of tax under this Part, the Minister 
shall, for the purpose of this section, allocate 
an amount to one or more of them for the 
taxation year, which amount or the total of 
which amounts, as the case may be, shall equal 
$200,000 in respect of a taxation year prior to 
1997 or $300,000 in respect of the 1997 or 
subsequent taxation years, and  in any such 
case, notwithstanding subsection (2), the 
business limit for each of the corporations is 
the amount so allocated to it.
