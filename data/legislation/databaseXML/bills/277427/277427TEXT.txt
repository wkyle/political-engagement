Application 
for remand

752.1 (1) Where an offender is convicted of 
a serious personal injury offence,  an offence 
referred to in paragraph 753.1(2)(a) or a child 
predator offence as defined in subsection 
129(9) of the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act  and, before sentence is imposed 
on the offender, on application by the 
prosecution, the court is of the opinion that 
there are reasonable grounds to believe that 
the offender might be found to be a dangerous 
offender under section 753,  a long-term 
offender under section 753.1 or a child 
predator under section 753.11 , the court may, 
by order in writing, remand the offender, for a 
period not exceeding sixty days, to the custody 
of the person that the court directs and who can 
perform an assessment, or can have an 
assessment performed by experts. The 
assessment is to be used as evidence in an 
application under section 753,  753.1 or 
753.11 .










7. The Act is amended by adding the 
following after section 753.1:







Application 
for finding 
that an 
offender is a 
child predator


753.11 (1) The court may, on application 
made under this Part following the filing of an 
assessment report under subsection 752.1(2), 
find an offender to be a child predator if it is 
satisfied that










(a) the offence for which the offender has 
been convicted is a child predator offence as 
defined in subsection 129(9) of the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act; 
and









(b) the offender has exhibited, in relation to 
any offence for which the offender has been 
convicted under this Act, conduct that









(i) constitutes a threat to the life, safety or 
physical or mental well-being of children 
on the basis of evidence that the 
offender's pattern of behaviour shows a 
substantial degree of indifference by the 
offender to the reasonably foreseeable 
consequences of that behaviour for 
children, or









(ii) shows a pattern of failure to control 
sexual impulses that establishes a 
likelihood of causing injury, pain or other 
evil to children in the future.






Time for 
making 
application


(2) An application under subsection (1) 
must be made before sentence is imposed on 
the offender unless










(a) before the imposition of sentence, the 
prosecution gives notice to the offender of 
a possible intention to make an application 
under section 752.1 and an application 
under subsection (1) not later than six 
months after that imposition; and









(b) at the time of the application under 
subsection (1) that is not later than six 
months after the imposition of sentence, it 
is shown that relevant evidence that was not 
reasonably available to the prosecution at 
the time of the imposition of sentence 
became available in the interim.






Application 
for demand 
for assessment 
after 
imposition of 
sentence


(3) Notwithstanding subsection 752.1(1), 
an application under that subsection may be 
made after the imposition of sentence or after 
an offender begins to serve the sentence in a 
case to which paragraphs (2)(a) and (b) apply.







If offender 
found to be a 
child predator


(4) If the court finds an offender to be a child 
predator, the court shall










(a) if the offender has been convicted of 
more than one child predator offence, 
impose a sentence of detention in a 
penitentiary for an indeterminate period;









(b) make an order requiring the offender to 
undergo counselling respecting sexuality 
and children;









(c) make an order requiring the offender not 
to undertake any employment, office or 
voluntary service in which the offender has 
sole or shared custody of children, and apart 
from necessary travel, not to be at or near 
any place where children are likely to be 
present without adults, for a period of at 
least five years after release;









(d) make an order requiring the offender to 
be subject, at all times of the day and night, 
to electronic surveillance for a period of at 
least five years after release; and









(e) make an order requiring the offender to 
report in person to a police officer at least 
every 30 days and give information on their 
place of work and place of residence, for a 
period of at least five years after release.






If application 
made after 
sentencing


(5) If the application is made after the 
offender begins to serve the sentence in a case 
to which paragraphs (2)(a) and (b) apply, the 
sentence of detention in a penitentiary for an 
indeterminate period referred to in subsection 
(4) replaces the sentence that was imposed for 
the offence for which the offender was 
convicted.







If offender not 
found to be a 
child predator


(6) If the court does not find an offender to 
be a child predator, the court may










(a) treat the application as an application to 
find the offender to be a long-term offender, 
in which case section 753.1 applies to the 
application and the court may either find 
that the offender is a long-term offender or 
hold another hearing for that purpose, or









(b) impose sentence for the offence for 
which the offender has been convicted,









and, in either case, the court shall make an 
order under paragraphs (4)(c) and (e) and may 
make an order under paragraph (4)(b) or (d).







Victim 
evidence


(7) Any evidence given during the hearing 
of an application made under subsection (1) 
by a victim of an offence for which the 
offender was convicted is deemed also to have 
been given during any hearing under 
paragraph (6)(a) held with respect to the 
offender.







Offence - 
breach of 
order


(8) An offender who breaches an order of a 
court made under this section is guilty of an 
indictable offence and liable to imprisonment 
for a term not exceeding two years.







Procedure for 
enforcement


(9) The Minister of Justice shall establish 
procedures to ensure that










(a) if an offender is in breach of an order 
under paragraph (4)(b), (c) or (d), or









(b) if an offender who is subject to an order 
under paragraph (4)(e) fails to report as 
required by the order or to provide a 
credible reason for the failure within 
forty-eight hours of the time the offender 
should have reported,









notice of the breach or failure is given 
forthwith to the law enforcement agencies in 
the areas where the offender resides, where the 
offender last reported or where the Minister 
believes the offender may be found and a 
warrant is issued forthwith for the arrest of the 
offender.
