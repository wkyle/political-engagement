CHAPTER 15 











An Act respecting royal assent to bills passed 
by the Houses of Parliament










[Assented to 4th June, 2002] 







Preamble


Whereas royal assent is the constitutional 
culmination of the legislative process;










 Whereas the customary ceremony of royal 
assent, which assembles the three constituent 
entities of Parliament, is an important 
legislative tradition to be preserved;










 And whereas it is desirable to facilitate the 
work of Parliament and the process of 
enactment by enabling royal assent to be 
signified by written declaration;










 Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with 
the advice and consent of the Senate and 
House of Commons of Canada, enacts as 
follows:










 






Short title


1. This Act may be cited as the Royal Assent 
Act.







Form and 
manner of 
royal assent


2. Royal assent to a bill passed by the 
Houses of Parliament may be signified, during 
the session in which both Houses pass the bill,










(a) in Parliament assembled; or









(b) by written declaration.






Use of 
customary 
form and 
manner


3. (1) Royal assent shall be signified in 
Parliament assembled at least twice in each 
calendar year.







Minimum 
requirement


(2) Royal assent shall be signified in 
Parliament assembled in the case of the first 
bill of the session appropriating sums for the 
public service of Canada based upon main or 
supplementary estimates.







Witness of 
assent


(3) The signification of royal assent by 
written declaration may be witnessed by more 
than one member from each House of 
Parliament.







Notification in 
Parliament


4. Each House of Parliament shall be 
notified of a written declaration of royal assent 
by the Speaker of that House or by the person 
acting as Speaker.







Date of assent


5. Where royal assent is signified by written 
declaration, the Act is deemed to be assented 
to on the day on which the two Houses of 
Parliament have been notified of the 
declaration.







Declaration 
not a statutory 
instrument


6. A written declaration of royal assent is 
not a statutory instrument for the purposes of 
the Statutory Instruments Act.







Saving


7. No royal assent is invalid only because 
section 3 is not complied with.
