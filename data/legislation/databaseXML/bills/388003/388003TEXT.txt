1st Session, 37th Parliament,
49-50-51 Elizabeth II, 2001-2002 










House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-56









An Act respecting assisted human 
reproduction










Her Majesty, by and with the advice and 
consent of the Senate and House of Commons 
of Canada, enacts as follows:









SHORT TITLE






Short title


1. This Act may be cited as the Assisted 
Human Reproduction Act.










PRINCIPLES






Declaration


2. The Parliament of Canada recognizes 
and declares that










(a) the benefits of assisted human 
reproductive technologies and related 
research for individuals and for society in 
general can be most effectively secured by 
taking appropriate measures for the 
protection and promotion of human health, 
safety, dignity and rights in the use of these 
technologies and in related research;









(b) the health and well-being of children 
born through the application of these 
technologies must be given priority in all 
decisions respecting their use;









(c) while all persons are affected by these 
technologies, women more than men are 
directly and significantly affected by their 
application;









(d) the principle of free and informed 
consent must be promoted and applied as a 
fundamental condition of the use of human 
reproductive technologies;









(e) trade in the reproductive capacities of 
women and men and the exploitation of 
children, women and men for commercial 
ends raise health and ethical concerns that 
justify their prohibition; and









(f) human individuality and diversity, and 
the integrity of the human genome, must be 
preserved and protected.
