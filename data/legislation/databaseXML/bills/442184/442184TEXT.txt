1st Session, 37th Parliament,
49-50-51 Elizabeth II, 2001-2002 










House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-473









An Act to ensure the necessary supply of 
patented drugs in cases of domestic 
emergency or to deal with crises in 
countries that receive assistance from 
Canada







Preamble


Whereas terrorist threats and the 
possibility of biochemical warfare make it 
prudent for the Government to ensure the 
immediate availability of drugs to protect 
persons in Canada or representing Canada 
overseas;










 Whereas the rate of spread of disease, 
including HIV, AIDS and tuberculosis, is 
serious and tragic in many countries and 
threatens a substantial proportion of the 
population in some of those countries;










 Whereas the spread of disease threatens to 
create an international crisis of a scale that is 
unprecedented and likely to bring human 
devastation and economic disaster to many of 
the poorest nations of the world, a situation 
which is made even worse by the fact that it is 
selective on the basis of poverty;










 Whereas drugs are available to provide 
protection from, cure or mitigate the effects of 
many diseases and biological or biochemical 
hazards, but the production of many such 
drugs is protected by patents;










 Whereas Canada, having international 
credibility and influence, should take a lead in 
initiating international co-operation among 
industrialized nations to make drugs available 
at a reasonable price to nations suffering 
medical crises;










 And Whereas drug manufacturers have 
little real expectation of significant profit 
from the sale of expensive drugs in nations 
that cannot afford them;










Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:

PROTECTION FROM BIOCHEMICAL AGGRESSION






Protection 
plan


3. (1) The Minister, in co-operation with the 
Minister of Health, must develop a protection 
plan to ensure access to sufficient biochemical 
protection drugs to protect the public from a 
potential biochemical threat or to deal with 
biochemical aggression.







Elements of 
plan


(2) The protection plan referred to in 
subsection (1) must include at least the 
following elements:










(a) provision for action to be initiated by 
order of the Governor in Council;









(b) provision for the action initiated by 
order of the Governor in Council to be 
administered by the Minister of Health;









(c) authority for the Governor in Council to 
order that one or more manufacturers, other 
than the patentee of any patent covering a 
biochemical protection drug, may be 
authorized by the Minister of Health to 
manufacture the drug if the patentee is 
unable or unwilling to supply the drug in the 
quantity, quality and time specified by the 
Minister of Health;









(d) a mechanism for determining the 
payment to a person who manufactures a 
biochemical protection drug at the request 
of the Minister of Health, which payment 
shall provide for a reasonable return on the 
incremental cost of the drug, and for 
determining the payment to the patentee of 
a patent covering the manufacture or use of 
the drug; and









(e) provision for an extension of the life of 
a patent covering the manufacture or use of 
a biochemical protection drug, in cases 
where









(i) the supply of the drug under the plan 
is likely to severely impair the ability of 
the patentee to obtain a reasonable return 
on the cost of developing the drug, and









(ii) no other reasonable remedy may be 
found.






Time limit


(3) The Minister must complete the 
protection plan not later than 180 days after 
this Act comes into force.







Plan laid 
before 
Parliament


4. (1) The Minister must cause the 
protection plan referred to in section 3 to be 
laid before each House of Parliament on any 
of the first five days on which the House sits 
after the plan is completed and must, at the 
same time, provide an outline of any 
amendment to the Patent Act or of any other 
legislation that would be necessary to put the 
plan into effect.







Committee 
study of plan


(2) On the laying of the protection plan and 
outline of legislation before the House of 
Commons, the Minister is deemed to have 
moved a resolution that the plan and outline be 
referred to such standing committee of the 
House as the House may order for 
consideration and report within 90 days or 
such longer time as the House may order.










INTERIM POWERS






Order in first 
year


5. (1) During the year commencing on the 
day on which this Act comes into force, the 
Governor in Council, on the recommendation 
of the Minister of Health, may










(a) order that the patentee of a patent 
covering the manufacture or use of a 
biochemical protection drug supply the 
drug to the Minister of Health in the 
quantity, quality and time specified, for a 
payment determined by the Minister, which 
shall provide for a reasonable return on the 
incremental cost of the drug; or









(b) if the patentee is unable or unwilling to 
supply the drug in the quantity, quality and 
time specified and for the payment 
determined by the Minister, order a 
manufacturer other that the patentee to 
manufacture the drug for the Minister of 
Health in the quantity, quality and time 
specified, for the payment determined by 
the Minister, which shall provide for a 
reasonable return on the incremental cost of 
the drug, and authorize the Minister to 
provide the patentee with such 
compensation as the Minister determines, 
in lieu of a royalty.

respect of a right arising under the Patent Act, 
except under subsection (3).







Application to 
Federal Court

INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE






International 
conference


6. The Minister must, in co-operation with 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the 
Minister of Health, within 180 days after the 
coming into force of this Act, convene a 
conference of










(a) representatives of nations that are 
capable of assisting those nations 
threatened by an epidemic disease;

an epidemic disease;









(c) experts on the spread, prevention and 
treatment of epidemic diseases; and

epidemic disease drugs.






Objectives


7. The objectives of the conference are to










(a) consider and propose a program of 
international co-operation to supply drugs 
at not more than their incremental cost to 
nations threatened by an epidemic disease;









(b) consider and propose means to secure 
the co-operation of manufacturers of 
epidemic disease drugs in the program, 
including, without limiting the generality of 
the foregoing, securing their agreement to 
supply drugs at incremental cost, plus a 
moderate profit as compensation for loss of 
legitimate expectation of profits from sales 
to the affected countries that might occur in 
the absence of initiatives under this Act;









(c) consider and propose means of 
compelling the manufacturers of epidemic 
disease drugs to supply them at incremental 
cost plus a moderate profit if reasonable 
offers to secure co-operation in the program 
fail;









(d) propose assistance with education on 
disease control and reduction for the 
populations of nations threatened by an 
epidemic disease;









(e) propose in general terms any 
amendments to patent legislation that may 
be needed to facilitate the program; and









(f) urge delegates to attempt to secure the 
commitment of the governments of the 
nations they represent to participate in and 
fund the program for drug supply and 
education assistance proposed by the 
conference.






Report


8. (1) The Minister must, within 60 days 
after the end of the conference, prepare a 
report on the conference, including a 
summary of its deliberations and conclusions

presented to Parliament to carry out the 
program considered and proposed at the 
conference.







Laid before 
Parliament


(2) The Minister must cause the report to be 
laid before each House of Parliament on any 
of the first five days on which the House sits
