House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-474









An Act to amend the Pension Benefits 
Standards Act, 1985







Preamble


Whereas it is necessary to ensure that a 
pension plan is managed in a way that ensures 
sufficient independence from the employer 
who establishes it and adequate protection and 
security for the employees' interests;










 Whereas employees' interests in a pension 
plan must be protected by a statutory 
limitation on the proportion of the assets of a 
pension fund that may be invested in or lent to 
the employer;










 And Whereas employees who purchase 
securities of the employer as a part of a defined 
contribution plan should have the same right 
to sell or trade in the securities as the directors 
and officers of the employer and should have 
timely access to information that might affect 
the employer's securities;
