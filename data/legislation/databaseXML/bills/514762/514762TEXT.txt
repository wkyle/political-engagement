51 ELIZABETH II









CHAPTER 28











An Act to protect human health and safety and 
the environment by regulating products 
used for the control of pests










[Assented to 12th December, 2002] 







Preamble


WHEREAS the availability and use of pest 
control products pose potential risks, both 
directly and indirectly, to the health, safety 
and well-being of people in Canada and to the 
environment;










 WHEREAS pest management plays a 
significant role in diverse areas of the 
economy and other aspects of the quality of 
life throughout Canada;










 WHEREAS pest control products of 
acceptable risk and value can contribute 
significantly to the attainment of the goals of 
sustainable pest management;










 WHEREAS the goals of sustainable pest 
management are to meet society's needs for 
human health protection, food and fibre 
production and resource utilization and to 
conserve or enhance natural resources and the 
quality of the environment for future 
generations, in an economically viable 
manner;










 WHEREAS Canada and the provinces and 
territories have traditionally administered 
complementary regulatory systems designed 
to protect people and the environment, 
including its biological diversity, from 
unacceptable risks posed by pest control 
products, and it is important that such an 
approach be continued in order to achieve 
mutually desired results efficiently, without 
regulatory conflict or duplication;










 WHEREAS it is in the national interest that










the primary objective of the federal 
regulatory system be to prevent 
unacceptable risks to people and the 
environment from the use of pest control 
products,









the attainment of the objectives of the 
federal regulatory system continue to be 
pursued through a scientifically-based 
national registration system that addresses 
risks to human health and the environment 
both before and after registration and 
applies to the regulation of pest control 
products throughout Canada,









pest control products of acceptable risk be 
registered for use only if it is shown that 
their use would be efficacious and if 
conditions of registration can be established 
to prevent adverse health impact or 
pollution of the environment,









in assessing risks to humans, consideration 
be given to aggregate exposure to pest 
control products, cumulative effects of pest 
control products and the different 
sensitivities to pest control products of 
major identifiable subgroups, including 
pregnant women, infants, children, women 
and seniors,









pest control products be regulated in a 
manner that supports sustainable 
development, being development that 
meets the needs of the present without 
compromising the ability of future 
generations to meet their own needs,









the federal regulatory system be designed to 
minimize health and environmental risks 
posed by pest control products and to 
encourage the development and 
implementation of innovative, sustainable 
pest management strategies, for example by 
facilitating access to pest control products 
that pose lower risks, and encouraging the 
development and use of alternative, 
non-toxic, ecological pest control 
approaches, strategies and products,









applicable policies of the Government of 
Canada that are consistent with the 
objectives of this Act be duly reflected in 
decisions respecting the regulation of pest 
control products,









there be cooperation among federal 
departments in the development of policies 
to pursue the attainment of the objectives of 
this Act, and that those policies take into 
account advice from diverse sources 
throughout the country,









the provinces and territories and those 
whose interests and concerns are affected 
by the federal regulatory system be 
accorded a reasonable opportunity to 
participate in the regulatory system in ways 
that are consistent with the attainment of its 
objectives, and









the federal regulatory system be 
administered efficiently and effectively in 
accordance with the foregoing principles 
and objectives and in a manner that 
recognizes the various interests and 
concerns affected and, where consistent 
with the primary objective of the system, 
minimizes the negative impact on 
economic viability and competitiveness;









 AND WHEREAS Canada must be able to 
fulfil its international obligations in relation to 
pest management;










NOW, THEREFORE, Her Majesty, by and 
with the advice and consent of the Senate and 
House of Commons of Canada, enacts as 
follows:
