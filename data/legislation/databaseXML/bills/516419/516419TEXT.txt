« revenu net 
moyen »


``average netback'' means the average of the 
netback to farm gate per acre for each of the

``input cost'' means the cost of production of 
a designated product, including but not 
limited to cost for land and buildings, 
labour, fuel, utilities, seed, fertilizer,

and typical yields of marketable product at 
the time in the zone.

and Agri-Food.







``netback to 
farm gate''
« revenu net

netback to farm gate of designated products

(d) prescribing terms that are by this Act to 
be prescribed.






Independent 
auditor

regulation for the purposes of paragraph (1)(b)

purposes of this Act after consultation with 
representatives of the farming community; 
and

Support 
payments


4. In respect of every year, the Minister shall 
designate a payment per hectare to be made to 
every family farm in a farming zone, for land 
that is qualifying land in that year on the farm, 
that equals the amount, if any, by which the 
average cost exceeds the average netback to 
farm gate, per hectare of production of 
designated products in the farming zone, 
weight averaged by the amount of each 
designated product produced in the zone in 
that year and the previous two years.
