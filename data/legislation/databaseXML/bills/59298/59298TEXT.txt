49-50 Elizabeth II, 2001 










House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-395









An Act respecting a National Crime Stoppers' 
Day







Preamble


Whereas Crime Stoppers is an internation
al organization with over 1 100 programs in 
operation around the world, including 75 in 
Canada;










 Whereas Crime Stoppers, as of the year 
2001, had helped to recover almost $1 billion 
in Canadian property and in narcotics, and to 
solve over 150 000 cases;










 Whereas Crime Stoppers helps to free up 
police resources by focussing attention on 
cases which underfunded police agencies may 
not otherwise be able to solve;










 Whereas Crime Stoppers programs are 
entirely voluntary, work in partnership with 
municipal, provincial and federal police 
agencies, and receive no government funding;










 Whereas a ``National Crime Stoppers' 
Day'' would help to provide members of 
Parliament and the general public with a better 
understanding of this valuable organization;










 Whereas such a day would also recognize 
the organization's contributors and 
volunteers, who help to fight crime in 
communities across Canada;










 And Whereas the people of Canada wish to 
honour and recognize the valuable 
contribution made by Crime Stoppers to 
Canada and its citizens;










Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:
