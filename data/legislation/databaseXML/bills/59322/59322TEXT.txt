of the same person or the same domestic 
establishment and where two or more 
individuals, none of whom is an individual 
referred to in subparagraph (1)(b)(ii), are  
otherwise entitled to such a deduction and

respect of the same child, an amount under 
subsection (1) because of paragraph (b) of the 
description of B in that subsection, the 
individual and the spouse or common-law 
partner or former spouse or common-law 
partner may each deduct a portion of that 
amount based on the number of days the child 
lived in that year with the individual or spouse 
or common-law partner or former spouse or 
common-law partner, as the case may be, 
which in the case of the individual shall be at 
least one hundred days in that year or such 
number of days as is prescribed by a regulation 
made under section 118.01. Any disagreement 
between the individual and the spouse or

or pursuant to any mechanism established by 
a regulation made under section 118.01.

common-law partner or former spouse or 
common-law partner of that individual are, in 
respect of a taxation year, each entitled to 
deduct, in respect of the same child, an amount 
under subsection (1) because of paragraph (b) 
of the description of B in that subsection, the 
total of all amounts so deducted for the year 
shall not exceed the maximum amount that 
would be deductible by reason of that 
paragraph for the year by either the individual 
or the individual's spouse or common-law 
partner or former spouse or common-law 
partner in respect of that child if the individual 
or individual's spouse or common-law partner 
or former spouse or common-law partner was 
the only person entitled to deduct an amount 
for the year by reason of that paragraph for that 
child.
