House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-19









An Act to provide for real property taxation 
powers of first nations, to create a First 
Nations Tax Commission, First Nations 
Financial Management Board, First 
Nations Finance Authority and First 
Nations Statistical Institute and to make 
consequential amendments to other Acts







Preamble


Whereas the Government of Canada has 
adopted a policy recognizing the inherent 
right of self-government as an aboriginal right 
and providing for the negotiation of 
self-government;










 Whereas this Act is not intended to define 
the nature and scope of any right of 
self-government or to prejudge the outcome of 
any self-government negotiation;










 Whereas the creation of national aboriginal 
institutions will assist first nations that choose 
to exercise real property taxation jurisdiction 
on reserve lands;










 Whereas economic development through 
the application of real property tax revenues 
and other local revenues to support borrowing 
on capital markets for the development of 
public infrastructure is available to other 
governments in Canada;










 Whereas real property taxation regimes on 
reserves should recognize both the interests of 
on-reserve taxpayers and the rights of 
members of first nations communities;










 Whereas accurate, timely and credible 
statistics are a key element of sound financial 
planning, management and reporting 
available to other governments in Canada;










 Whereas first nations led an initiative that 
resulted in 1988 in an amendment to the 
Indian Act so that their jurisdiction over real 
property taxation on reserve could be 
exercised and the Indian Taxation Advisory 
Board was created to assist in the exercise of 
that jurisdiction;










 Whereas, in 1995, the First Nations Finance 
Authority Inc. was incorporated for the 
purposes of issuing debentures using real 
property tax revenues and providing 
investment opportunities;










 Whereas, by 1999, first nations and the 
Government of Canada recognized the 
benefits of establishing statutory institutions 
as part of a comprehensive fiscal and 
statistical management system;










 And whereas first nations have led an 
initiative culminating in the introduction of 
this Act;










NOW, THEREFORE, Her Majesty, by and 
with the advice and consent of the Senate and 
House of Commons of Canada, enacts as 
follows:
