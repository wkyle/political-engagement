1st Session, 37th Parliament,
49-50 Elizabeth II, 2001 










House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-403









An Act respecting fugitives in Canada from 
justice in other countries







Preamble


Whereas an increasing number of persons 
in Canada are in custody or released on bail in 
Canada with respect to crimes alleged to have 
been committed in other countries;










 Whereas Canada has a legitimate and 
internationally recognized policy that 
extradition is allowed only in cases where it is 
established that there is a proper charge to be 
answered and that the internationally accepted 
human rights of the prisoner in the country 
seeking extradition will be respected;










  And Whereas by the use of the procedures 
and appeals allowed by law in Canada, some 
fugitives are able to defer a final 
determination of an extradition request for an 
extended period of time;










Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:










 






Short title


1. This Act may be cited as the Fugitives 
from justice in other countries Act.







Report on 
extradition


2. (1) The Minister of Justice shall cause to 
be laid before each House of Parliament, no 
later than the third day after April 1 that the 
House in question is sitting, a report 
respecting the preceding year showing, 
without naming or identifying any person:










(a) the number of persons for whom an 
extradition request was received from 
another country;









(b) the number of such cases where the 
accused has not been found in Canada and 
the number of such cases where the accused 
is, on reasonable grounds, believed to be at 
large in Canada;









(c) the number of persons extradited to 
another country during the year;









(d) the nature of the crimes of which all 
those persons against whom extradition is 
sought, including requests received during 
the year and unresolved requests from 
previous years, showing the type of crime 
and the number of persons accused with a 
crime of that type;









(e) the average time in months that was 
taken to finally determine the cases that 
were determined in the year; and









(f) an estimate of the cost to the public of 
finding, arresting, keeping in custody, 
prosecuting, defending and considering 
extradition of persons against whom 
extradition is sought, including legal aid, 
prosecutors' time, court costs and costs of 
search, apprehension and custody.






Referral to 
committee


(2) The report shall be deemed referred to 
such standing committee of each House that 
normally considers matters of justice for the 
committees' consideration and report 
according to the instructions given by each 
House.







Committee 
report


3. Without limiting the instructions that a 
House of Parliament may give to a standing 
committee under subsection 2(2), the report of 
the committee shall include the committee's 
recommendations as to










(a) whether the committee believes that the 
extradition process is working well in 
Canada;









(b) whether unreasonable delay is occurring 
in resolving extradition requests, and, if so, 
what causes the delay;









(c) whether the committee considers that 
the appropriate balance is made between 
international cooperation with respect to 
law enforcement and the rights of the 
accused;









(d) the committee's recommendations, if 
any, on legislative or policy changes that 
would improve the extradition process 
without unduly affecting the legitimate 
protection of the human rights of the 
accused; and









(e) any question of law, including, for 
greater certainty, international law, relating 
to extradition that the committee believes 
should be referred by the Governor in 
Council to the Supreme Court of Canada for 
an opinion.






Minister's 
response to 
report


4. If a committee reports recommendations 
for legislative or policy changes, the Minister 
of Justice shall, within sixty days of the 
presentation of the report, or on any of the 
three days on which the House in question 
next sits following the sixty days, cause to be 
laid before each House of Parliament a 
statement of the changes the Minister intends 
to introduce in Parliament by way of 
legislation, or to initiate as policy changes.







Call for 
debate on 
report


5. (1) After the response by the Minister 
mentioned in section 4, if any member of 
either House of Parliament moves that the 
report of a committee made pursuant to 
section 3 be debated, the Speaker shall, 
without permitting debate, ask for those 
members supporting the motion to rise and, if 
fifty members or more rise, then the 
Government House Leader shall, on any of the 
next five days on which the House sits, 
announce a date, within thirty days on which 
the report shall be called for debate in the 
House and no less than three hours shall be 
allowed for debate.







Vote on 
committee 
report


(2) At the end of the debate, or at the time 
that no further member rises to speak in the 
debate, the House shall vote on the report and 
shall concur it, amend it and concur in it or 
determine that it not be concurred in.







Expiry


6. This Act expires on December 31, 2006.
