state or other political subdivision of a 
foreign state, a colony, dependency, 
possession, protectorate, condominium, 
trust territory or any territory falling under

PURPOSE AND PRINCIPLES






Purpose


3. The purpose of this Act is to contribute to 
the administration of justice and the 
rehabilitation of offenders and their 
reintegration into the community by enabling 
offenders to serve their sentences in the 
country of which they are citizens or 
nationals.







Dual 
criminality


4. (1) Subject to subsection (3), a transfer is 
not available unless the Canadian offender's 
conduct would have constituted a criminal 
offence if it had occurred in Canada at the time 
the Minister receives the request for a transfer.







Conduct 
determinative


(2) For greater certainty, it is not relevant 
whether the conduct referred to in subsection 
(1) is named, defined or characterized by the 
foreign entity in the same way as it is in 
Canada.







Exception - 
children


(3) A transfer is available to a Canadian 
offender who, at the time the offence was 
committed, was a child within the meaning of 
the Youth Criminal Justice Act even if their 
conduct would not have constituted a criminal 
offence if it had occurred in Canada at that 
time. That offender may not be detained in 
Canada.







Effect of 
transfer


5. (1) A transfer may not have the effect of 
increasing a sentence imposed by a foreign 
entity or of invalidating a guilty verdict 
rendered, or a sentence imposed, by a foreign 
entity. The verdict and the sentence, if any, are 
not subject to any appeal or other form of 
review in Canada.







Evidence


(2) A document supplied by a foreign entity 
that sets out a finding of guilt and a sentence, 
if any, and purports to be signed by a judicial 
official or a director of a place of confinement 
in the foreign entity is proof of the facts 
alleged, in the absence of evidence to the 
contrary and without proof of the signature or 
official character of the person appearing to 
have signed it.










MINISTER






Administra-
tion of Act


6. (1) The Minister is responsible for the 
administration of this Act.







Designation 
by Minister


(2) The Minister may, in writing, designate, 
by name or position, a staff member within the 
meaning of subsection 2(1) of the Corrections 
and Conditional Release Act to act on the 
Minister's behalf under section 8, 12, 15, 24, 
30 or 37.







Request for 
transfer


7. A person may not be transferred under a 
treaty, or an administrative arrangement 
entered into under section 31 or 32, unless a 
request is made, in writing, to the Minister.










CONSENT






Consent of 
three parties


8. (1) The consent of the three parties to a 
transfer - the offender, the foreign entity and 
Canada - is required.







Withdrawal of 
consent


(2) A foreign offender - and, subject to the 
laws of the foreign entity, a Canadian 
offender - may withdraw their consent at 
any time before the transfer takes place.







Information 
about treaties


(3) The Minister or the relevant provincial 
authority, as the case may be, shall inform a 
foreign offender, and the Minister shall take 
all reasonable steps to inform a Canadian 
offender, of the substance of any treaty - or 
administrative arrangement entered into 
under section 31 or 32 - that applies to them.







Information 
about 
sentence


(4) The Minister shall, in writing, inform a 
Canadian offender as to how their foreign 
sentence is to be served in Canada and shall 
deliver to a foreign offender the information 
provided to the Minister by the foreign entity 
as to how their Canadian sentence is to be 
served.







Person 
authorized to 
consent


(5) In respect of the following persons, 
consent is given by whoever is authorized to 
consent in accordance with the laws of the 
province where the person is detained, is 
released on conditions or is to be transferred:










(a) a child or young person within the 
meaning of the Youth Criminal Justice Act;









(b) a person who is not able to consent and 
in respect of whom a verdict of not 
criminally responsible on account of mental 
disorder or of unfit to stand trial has been 
rendered; and









(c) an offender who is not able to consent.






Provincial 
authority


9. (1) If a foreign offender is - or a 
Canadian offender would, after their transfer, 
be - under the authority of a province or if a 
Canadian offender is a child within the 
meaning of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, the 
consent of the Minister and the relevant 
provincial authority is required.







Purpose and 
principles


(2) In determining whether to consent to a 
transfer, the provincial authority shall take 
into account the purpose and principles of this 
Act.







Factors - 
Canadian 
offenders


10. (1) In determining whether to consent to 
the transfer of a Canadian offender, the 
Minister shall consider the following factors:










(a) whether the offender's return to Canada 
would constitute a threat to the security of 
Canada;









(b) whether the offender left or remained 
outside Canada with the intention of 
abandoning Canada as their place of 
permanent residence;









(c) whether the offender has social or family 
ties in Canada; and









(d) whether the foreign entity or its prison 
system presents a serious threat to the 
offender's security or human rights.  






Factors - 
Canadian and 
foreign 
offenders


(2) In determining whether to consent to the 
transfer of a Canadian or foreign offender, the 
Minister shall consider the following factors:










(a) whether, in the Minister's opinion, the 
offender will, after the transfer, commit a 
terrorism offence or criminal organization 
offence within the meaning of section 2 of 
the Criminal Code; and









(b) whether the offender was previously 
transferred under this Act or the Transfer of 
Offenders Act, chapter T-15 of the Revised 
Statutes of Canada, 1985.






Additional 
factor - 
Canadian 
young persons


(3) In determining whether to consent to the 
transfer of a Canadian offender who is a young 
person within the meaning of the Youth 
Criminal Justice Act, the Minister and the 
relevant provincial authority shall consider 
the best interests of the young person.







Primary 
consideration 
- Canadian 
children


(4) In determining whether to consent to the 
transfer of a Canadian offender who is a child 
within the meaning of the Youth Criminal 
Justice Act, the primary consideration of the 
Minister and the relevant provincial authority 
is to be the best interests of the child.







Writing


11. (1) A consent, a refusal of consent or a 
withdrawal of consent is to be given in 
writing.







Reasons


(2) If the Minister does not consent to a 
transfer, the Minister shall give reasons.







Consent 
voluntary


12. The Minister shall take all reasonable 
steps to determine whether an offender's 
consent has been given voluntarily.










CONTINUED ENFORCEMENT AND ADAPTATION






Continued 
enforcement


13. The enforcement of a Canadian 
offender's sentence is to be continued in 
accordance with the laws of Canada as if the 
offender had been convicted and their 
sentence imposed by a court in Canada.







Adaptation


14. Subject to subsection 17(1) and section 
18, if, at the time the Minister receives a 
request for the transfer of a Canadian offender, 
the sentence imposed by the foreign entity is 
longer than the maximum sentence provided 
for in Canadian law for the equivalent offence, 
the Canadian offender is to serve only the 
shorter sentence.







Equivalent 
offence


15. For the purposes of the application of 
any Act of Parliament to a Canadian offender, 
the Minister shall identify the criminal 
offence that, at the time the Minister receives 
their request for a transfer, is equivalent to the 
offence of which the Canadian offender was 
convicted.










PROBATION






Deemed 
probation 
order


16. A foreign sentence that consists of a 
period of supervision, other than by reason of 
conditional release - or a period of 
supervision that is, other than by reason of a 
conditional release, an element of a foreign 
sentence of imprisonment of less than two 
years - is deemed to be a probation order 
under section 731 of the Criminal Code, to a 
maximum of three years, or under paragraph 
42(2)(k) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, to 
a maximum of two years.

imposed under paragraph 42(2)(q) of that 
Act if the sentence imposed by the foreign
