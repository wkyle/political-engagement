CHAPTER 32











An Act to amend the Criminal Code (impaired 
driving and related matters)










[Assented to 17th June, 1999] 







Preamble


 Whereas the Parliament of Canada 
recognizes that impaired driving continues to 
pose a very serious threat to the life and health 
of Canadians;










 Whereas the Parliament of Canada is 
committed to ensuring that the provisions of 
the Criminal Code respecting impaired 
driving have a sufficient deterrent effect on 
potential offenders;










 And Whereas the Parliament of Canada 
supports the principle that the sanctions to be 
imposed for an offence involving impaired 
driving must reflect the gravity of the offence 
as well as the degree of responsibility of the 
offender;










Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:
