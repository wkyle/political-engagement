The House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-488









Parliamentarians' Code of Conduct







Preamble


 Whereas service in Parliament is a public 
trust;










 Whereas Parliamentarians should have the 
highest ethical standards, so as to maintain 
and enhance public confidence and trust in the 
integrity of each Parliamentarian and in the 
institution of Parliament;










 Whereas Parliamentarians should perform 
their official duties and arrange their private 
affairs in a manner that will bear the closest 
public scrutiny;










 Whereas Parliamentarians should take 
care to avoid placing themselves under any 
financial or other obligation that might 
influence them in the performance of their 
official duties;










 Whereas upon entering office, 
Parliamentarians should arrange their private 
affairs so that any foreseeable real or apparent 
conflict of interest may be prevented, and if a 
conflict does nevertheless arise, it should be 
resolved in a way that protects the public 
interest;










 And Whereas Parliamentarians should not 
accept any gift or personal benefit in 
connection with their office that may 
reasonably be seen to compromise their 
personal judgment or integrity;










Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:
