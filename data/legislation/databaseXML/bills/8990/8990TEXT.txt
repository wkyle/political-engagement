or increase


3. (1) Where a regulating authority wishes 
to establish, increase, widen the application of 
or increase the duration of a user fee with 
effect from July 1, 1998 or later, the regulating 
authority must submit to the Committee a

lected in the first three fiscal years after the 
user fee is established or increased.






Minor change 
in incidence


(2) Where a regulating authority wishes to 
make a minor change in the definition of the 
persons to whom the fee is to apply, solely for 
the purpose of maintaining fairness or circum
venting avoidance, the authority shall report 
to the Committee the reasons for the change, 
and if the Committee approves the change, the 
authority may make the change without 
making a proposal under subsection (1).







Committee

House may pass a resolution approving, 
denying or amending the proposal.







Setting user 
fees

or increase a user fee after July 1, 1998 unless 
the authority has first made a proposal under 
section 3 and either










(a) the House of Commons has concurred in 
a report by the Committee approving the 
proposal or approving the proposal with 
amendments; or









(b) the House has passed a resolution under 
subsection (1) approving the proposal or 
approving the proposal with amendments.






Authority to 
follow 
recommen-
ded decreases


(3) Where a report as concurred in by the 
House of Commons or a resolution made by 
the House pursuant to subsection (1) recom
mends that a proposal be denied or the user fee 
be less than that proposed by the regulating 
authority as to amount, application or dura
tion, the regulating authority shall set the user 
fee in the manner recommended by the report 
as concurred in or as stated in the resolution, 
as the case may be.
