1st Session, 36th Parliament,
46 Elizabeth II, 1997










The House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-237









An Act to provide for a national referendum to 
authorize the Government of Canada to 
negotiate terms of separation with a 
province that has voted for separation 
from Canada







Preamble


 Whereas the Constitution of Canada does 
not provide for a process whereby a province 
or a part of a province may separate from 
Canada;










 Whereas, when a province or a part of a 
province has, by a vote of its electors, 
expressed a wish to separate from Canada, 
principles should exist in law for the 
determination of whether the expression is a 
legitimate representation of the wishes of the 
people of that province or part;










 Whereas, if the expression is a legitimate 
representation, the Government of Canada 
must seek the authority of the people of 
Canada to negotiate the terms of separation;










 And whereas the wishes of those who live 
in districts where there is no majority vote for 
separation must be respected;










Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:










 






Short title


1. This Act may be cited as the Negotiation 
of Terms of Separation Act.

« référendum

Interpreta-
tion


3. (1) In this section and in sections 4 
and 6, a reference to the Senate is void if the 
Senate is not at the time a House consisting 
only of Senators who have been elected to the 
Senate by vote of the electors of the province 
or, in the case of Quebec, the electoral district 
they represent.







Determi-
nation by 
Senate and 
House of 
Commons


(2) If a province holds a separation 
referendum and the question is answered in 
the affirmative, the Senate and House of 
Commons shall determine whether










(a) the question that was put was a simple 
and direct question asking whether the 
voter wished the province or part to separate 
from Canada;









(b) the affirmative vote was evidenced by a 
majority of at least fifty per cent of the valid 
ballots cast plus one vote;









(c) the separation referendum was held or 
put and recorded on the basis of the 
electoral districts described in the law of the 
separating province for the purpose of 
entitlement to representation by a member 
in the legislative assembly of the separating 
province;









(d) it was clearly stated by advertisements, 
in both official languages, published in the 
Canada Gazette and in every electoral 
district by publication in at least one 
newspaper with general circulation 
throughout the district, at least sixty days 
prior to polling day for the referendum, and 
clearly stated and conspicuously printed on 
the ballot to be marked by electors, on the 
same page as the voter is to mark the ballot, 
that a vote to separate means a vote to









(i) become a separate state, foreign to 
Canada,









(ii) cease to be a province of Canada,









(iii) cease to have representation in the 
Senate and House of Commons of 
Canada,









(iv) lose the right to be a citizen of 
Canada,









(v) lose the right to hold a Canadian 
passport, and









(vi) lose the right to unrestricted entry to 
and travel within Canada and the 
unrestricted right to work in Canada;









(e) it was made clear to the electors by 
advertisements, in both official languages, 
published in the Canada Gazette and in 
every electoral district by publication in at 
least one newspaper with general circula
tion throughout the district, at least sixty 
days prior to polling day for the referen
dum, and in the manner described in 
subsection 5(2), that the Government of 
Canada has no legislative authority to 
negotiate the separation of any electoral 
district in which a majority of at least fifty 
per cent of the valid ballots cast plus one 
vote are against separation from Canada; 
and









(f) any electoral district used in the referen
dum had been altered in a way that would 
significantly reduce the proportion of vot
ers who are aboriginal people or people 
with an ethnic origin other than French-Ca
nadian in the electoral district from that 
existing in the district at the provincial 
general election preceding the coming into 
force of this Act.

Supreme Court of Canada any question 
relating to the separation referendum or the 
matters to be determined under subsection (2) 
for the judgment of the Court, and the Court 
shall issue its judgment within ninety days of 
the date of referral or within such longer time 
not exceeding one hundred and eighty days as 
the Governor in Council may, on the request 
of the Court, order.







Calculation of 
time


(8) The time between the referral of a 
question to the Supreme Court of Canada 
pursuant to subsection (7) and the issuance of 
the judgment of the Court does not count in the 
ninety days referred to in subsection (4).
