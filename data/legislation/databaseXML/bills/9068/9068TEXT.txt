SUMMARY









The purpose of this enactment is to prevent the merger of banks with 
each other or with federally incorporated bodies to create one bank, 
unless the Superintendent of Financial Institutions advises the Minister 
of Finance that the merger is necessary to prevent an insolvency or 
informs the Minister that none of the applicants wishing to merge is 
about to become insolvent, in which case the merger would have to be 
approved by a resolution of the Senate and House of Commons.
