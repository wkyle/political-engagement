Her Majesty, by and with the advice and

1. Paragraph 7(b) of the Privacy Act is 
replaced by the following:










(b) for a purpose for which the information 
may be disclosed to the institution under 
subsection 8(2) or is required to be 
disclosed under subsection 8(2.1).  









2. Subsection 8(2) of the Act is amended 
by adding the word ``and'' at the end of 
paragraph (k) and by replacing paragraphs 
(l) and (m) by the following:










(l) to any government institution for the 
purpose of locating an individual in order to 
collect a debt owing to Her Majesty in right 
of Canada by that individual or make a 
payment owing to that individual by Her 
Majesty in right of Canada.






Where 
personal 
information 
shall be 
disclosed


(2.1) Subject to any other Act of 
Parliament, the head of a government 
institution shall disclose personal information 
under the control of a government institution  
for any purpose where the head of the 
institution is advised, in writing, by the 
Privacy Commissioner, that in the opinion of 
the Commissioner  










(a)  the public interest in disclosure clearly 
outweighs any invasion of privacy that 
could result from the disclosure, or









(b)  disclosure would clearly benefit the 
individual to whom the information relates,









and shall do so forthwith.










3. Subsection 8(5) of the Act is replaced 
by the following:







Notice of 
disclosure 
under 
subsection 
(2.1)


(5) Where  personal information is to be 
disclosed by  the head of a government 
institution pursuant to subsection (2.1) , the 
Privacy Commissioner may, if the 
Commissioner deems it appropriate, notify 
the individual to whom the information relates 
that the information is to be disclosed.
