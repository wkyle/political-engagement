to the satisfaction of the Chief Electoral 
Officer, the Chief Electoral Officer may, on 
application in writing by the claimant or by the 
candidate or their official agent, authorize in 
writing the payment by a candidate through 
their official agent of a claim for or in relation 
to any election where

agent; or









(b) the payment is to be made after the time

(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) and 
section 221, where cause is at any time shown 
to the satisfaction of a judge competent to 
recount the votes given at an election, that 
judge, on application by the claimant or by the 
candidate or their official agent, may, by 
order, give leave for the payment by a 
candidate through their official agent of










(a) a claim that was not sent in within the 
time specified by subsection 221(2) or paid 
within the time specified by subsection (1) 
if the claimant, candidate or official agent 
shows that they applied for but did not 
obtain an authorization under subsection 
(1.1); or









(b) a claim that was not paid in compliance 
with an authorization obtained under 
subsection (1.1) if the claimant, candidate 
or official agent shows that they were 
unable to comply with it by reason of a 
circumstance beyond their control.









(2) Subsection 222(2) of the Act, as it read 
immediately before the coming into force of

under subsection 222(1.1), disputes it or 
refuses or fails to pay it within the time 
specified by subsection 222(1) or authorized 
under subsection 222(1.1) for its payment, the

agent is aware, the official agent shall, within 
one week after the authorization or approval, 
comply with sections 228 to 230 and 232 to

pursuant to the authorization of the Chief 
Electoral Officer under subsection 222(1.1), 
pursuant to leave granted by a judge under 
subsection 222(2) or pursuant to a judgment or

authorization 
or order


(3) Where, after the date on which a return 
respecting election expenses is transmitted by 
an official agent, authorization is obtained 
under subsection 222(1.1) or leave is given 
under subsection 222(2) for any claims to be 
paid, the official agent shall, within seven 
days after the payment of the claims, transmit 
to the returning officer a return of the sums 
paid under that authorization or leave, 
accompanied by a copy of the authorization or 
order of the judge giving the leave and, in 
default, the official agent is deemed to have 
failed to comply with the requirements of this 
section and sections 228 to 236 and 238 to 240.










7. Section 238 of the Act is replaced by the 
following:







When return 
and 
declaration 
not 
transmitted


237.1 Where the return and declarations 
respecting election expenses of a candidate at 
an election have not been transmitted as 
required by this Act or, having been 
transmitted, contain an error or false 
statement,










(a) if the candidate applies in writing to the 
Chief Electoral Officer and shows that the 
failure to transmit or that the error or false 
statement arose by reason of the candidate's 
illness or the absence, death, illness or 
misconduct of their official agent or of a 
clerk or officer of that agent, or by reason of 
inadvertence or of any reasonable cause of 
a like nature, and not by reason of a want of 
good faith on the part of the candidate, or









(b) if the official agent of the candidate 
applies in writing to the Chief Electoral 
Officer and shows that the failure to 
transmit or that the error or false statement 
arose by reason of the official agent's illness 
or the death or illness of a prior official 
agent of the candidate, or the absence, 
death, illness or misconduct of a clerk or 
officer of the official agent or prior official 
agent, or by reason of inadvertence or of any 
reasonable cause of a like nature, and not by 
reason of a want of good faith on the part of 
the official agent,









the Chief Electoral Officer may, on 
production of any evidence of the grounds 
stated in the application and of the good faith 
of the applicant and any other evidence that 
the Chief Electoral Officer considers 
appropriate, authorize the transmission of the 
return and declarations within an extended 
time, or the retransmission of the return and 
declarations as amended to correct the error or 
false statement within an extended time, if 
necessary, as the case may be, and that 
transmission or retransmission constitutes 
transmission of the return and declarations 
respecting election expenses of a candidate at 
an election as required by this Act.







When return 
and 
declaration 
not 
transmitted or 
erroneous


238. Where the return and declarations 
respecting election expenses of a candidate at 
an election have not been transmitted as 
required by this Act or, having been 
transmitted, contain an error or false 
statement, and the candidate or their official 
agent applies to a judge competent to recount 
the votes given at the election, the judge may 
make an order for allowing an authorized 
excuse for the failure to transmit or for the 
error or false statement, that to the judge 
seems just if the candidate or official agent 
shows that the failure to transmit or that the 
error or false statement arose because of a 
reason set out in paragraph 237.1(a) or (b), as 
the case may be, and that the candidate or 
official agent either applied for and did not 
obtain an authorization under section 237.1 or, 
having obtained such an authorization, was 
unable to comply with it because of a 
circumstance beyond their control.
