offender resides in a province that has 
legislation governing alcohol-sensing ignition 
controls, order that










(a) a part of a fine or a part of a period of a 
sentence of imprisonment or probation 
order may be suspended if the offender 
undertakes to install and maintain in 
working order, for such period as the court 
may order, an alcohol-sensing ignition 
control on every motor vehicle that the 
offender operates;









(b) it be a condition of any probation order 
that the offender undertakes to install and 
maintain in working order, during the 
period of probation, an alcohol-sensing 
ignition control on every motor vehicle that 
the offender operates; and









(c) any suspended part of a fine or period of 
imprisonment or probation be served if the
