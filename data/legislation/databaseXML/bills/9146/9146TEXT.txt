1. The Criminal Code is amended by 
adding the following before section 1:







Preamble


 Whereas society needs the protection of 
the State from criminal activity that threatens 
or harms individuals or public or private 
property or disturbs the public peace;










 Whereas it is necessary to punish offenders 
to keep public peace and deter criminal 
activity;










 Whereas many offences have individual 
victims who are affected by the offence;










 And Whereas the obligations of the State 
to prosecute offenders must be accompanied 
by protection of the interests of the victims by 
keeping them fully informed of the details of 
the prosecution, giving them a right to be 
heard on the impact the offence has had on 
them and providing restitution for the offence;










Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:  










 









2. The Act is amended by adding the 
following after section 1:







Interpreta-
tion


1.1 This Act shall be interpreted and applied

(6) Where an accused has been charged 
with an offence, the person in charge of the 
prosecution of an offence who receives

to the person in charge of the prosecution of 
the accused.

or that any person listed as a victim pursuant 
to subsection (5), (6) or (7) be removed from

sentence on or discharging the offender or 
determining the appeal or application, must 
hear any victim of the offence who wishes to 
be heard on the impact the offence has had or
