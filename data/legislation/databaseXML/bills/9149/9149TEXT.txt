of silence

Suggestions


3. The following are suggested as ways in 
which the people of Canada could promote the 
pause and observance of the two minutes of 
silence:










(a) they could participate in a traditional 
Remembrance Day service at a war 
memorial or cenotaph;









(b) if they are driving, they could stop their 
vehicles along the side of the road and sit 
quietly for two minutes, where this is 
allowed and where it does not endanger the 
driver of the vehicle or others;









(c) they could gather in common areas in 
their workplaces to observe the two minutes 
of silence together;









(d) where possible, assembly lines could be 
shut down in factories for two minutes;









(e) Remembrance Day assemblies could be 
held in schools, colleges and universities; 
and









(f) Remembrance Day services could be 
held in places of worship.
