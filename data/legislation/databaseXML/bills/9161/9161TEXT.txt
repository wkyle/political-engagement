CRIMINAL RECORDS ACT









1. The Criminal Records Act is amended 
by replacing the enacting phrase by the 
following:







Preamble


 Whereas there are certain circumstances in 
which it may be appropriate to grant a pardon 
to a person who has been of good behaviour 
following a conviction for a criminal offence 
and a period following the completion of the 
sentence;










 Whereas, if a person has been granted a 
pardon for an offence, the record of that 
offence should be kept separate from other 
records and access thereto should be given 
only in cases where the public interest 
overrides the privacy of the record; and










 Whereas access to the record of an offence 
in respect of which a pardon has been granted 
should be available to the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police in connection with law 
enforcement, and to those responsible for the 
care of children to assist in reviewing 
applications for positions of trust regarding 
children;  










Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:










 









2. Section 6 of the Act is amended by 
adding the following after subsection (1):







Those 
responsible 
for children


(1.1) The Minister shall disclose a record of 
a sexual offence against a child in respect of 
which a pardon has been granted to a person 
requesting information on the criminal history 
of an applicant mentioned in paragraph (b), if 
the Minister is satisfied that










(a) the person is responsible for or 
represents an individual, organization or 
group who is responsible for the welfare of 
one or more children;









(b) the record is to be considered by the 
person, individual, organization or group in 
connection with the review of an 
application for a position in which the 
applicant would be placed in a position of 
trust involving the child or children; and









(c) the Minister has received an undertaking 
in writing, in a form prescribed by the 
Minister, from the person, individual, 
organization or group, as the Minister may 
require, that the record will be used only by 
the person, individual, organization or 
group in connection with the review 
referred to in paragraph (b) and will not be 
disclosed to any other person.






Notice to 
applicant


(1.2) When the Minister discloses a record 
pursuant to subsection (1.1), the Minister shall 
give notice of the disclosure to the applicant in 
writing, to the last address of the applicant 
known to the Minister, stating to whom the 
disclosure was made and what information 
was disclosed.







Offence and 
penalty


(1.3) Any one who discloses or uses a record 
in breach of an undertaking made pursuant to 
paragraph (1.1)(c) is guilty of an offence and 
liable to a fine of not less than one thousand 
dollars and not more than fifty thousand 
dollars if the accused is an employer, and not 
more than five thousand dollars in any other 
case, or to imprisonment for a term not 
exceeding six months, or to both fine and 
imprisonment.
