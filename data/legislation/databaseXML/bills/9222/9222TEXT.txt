House of Commons sits after January 1 in each 
year, the standing committee of the House of 
Commons that normally considers matters 
relating to consumers shall conduct a review 
of the bank charges imposed by a bank in

may hear any witness it considers relevant.







Contents of 
report

include










(a) a comprehensive description of the 
services in respect of which, in the opinion 
of the committee, a bank may reasonably 
impose bank charges; and









(b) a recommendation concerning the 
maximum charges that may be imposed by 
a bank in respect of such services.






Regulations


456.2 After the report has been laid before 
the House of Commons under section 456.1, 
the Governor in Council shall make 
regulations prohibiting a bank from










(a) imposing bank charges in respect of 
services other than those referred to in the 
report prepared under paragraph

charges than the amounts recommended in 
the report prepared under paragraph 
456.1(3)(b).






Offence


456.3 (1) Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this Act, a bank that contravenes 
a regulation made by the Governor in Council 
under section 456.2 thirty days after the 
regulation is made is guilty of an offence and 
liable on summary conviction to a fine not 
exceeding one thousand dollars.







Separate 
offence


(2) Where an offence under this section is 
committed or continued on more than one day, 
it shall be deemed to be a separate offence for 
each day on which the offence is committed or 
continued.

``bank 
charges''

456.3, ``bank charges'' means any charges 
imposed by a bank in respect of a service 
provided by the bank in Canada, with the
