of the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific Oceans 
and the Great Lakes and  that are of 
sufficient extent and such configuration 
as to maintain healthy marine 
ecosystems,









ensure that Canada contributes to 
international efforts for the 
establishment of a worldwide network of 
representative marine protected areas,









consider implications for ecosystems in 
the planning and management of marine 
conservation areas so established,









provide opportunities for the people of 
Canada and of the world to appreciate 
and enjoy Canada's natural and cultural 
marine heritage,









recognize that the marine environment is 
fundamental to the social, cultural and

coastal communities,  









provide opportunities within marine 
conservation areas for the ecologically 
sustainable use of marine resources for 
the lasting benefit of coastal 
communities;









promote an understanding of the marine 
environment and provide opportunities
