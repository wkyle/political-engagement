Her Majesty, by and with the advice and

of a spouse , may not make an application

are replaced by the following:







Past conduct


(9) In making an order under this section, 
the court shall not take into consideration the 
past conduct of any person unless the conduct 
is relevant to the ability of that person to act in 
the best interests  of the  child.







Maximum 
contact


(10) In making an order under this section, 
the court shall give effect to the principle that 
a child of the marriage should have as much 
contact with each spouse and each parent of a 
spouse  as is consistent with the best interests 
of the child and, for that purpose, shall take 
into consideration the willingness of the 
person for whom custody or access  is sought 
to facilitate such contact.










2. (1) Subsection 17(2) of the Act is 
replaced by the following:







Application 
by other 
person

Maximum 
contact


(9) In making a variation order varying a 
custody order, the court shall give effect to the 
principle that a child of the marriage should 
have as much contact with each former spouse 
and each parent of a spouse  as is consistent 
with the best interests of the child and, for that 
purpose, where the variation order would 
grant custody of or access to  the child to a 
person who does not currently have custody or 
access , the court shall take into consideration 
the willingness of that person to facilitate such 
contact.

three years


3. (1) On the expiration of three years

established for the purpose of 
subsection (1) shall review the provisions 
and operation of this Act and, within six

within such further time as the House of 
Commons may authorize, shall submit a 
report to Parliament thereon, including 
such recommendations pertaining to the
