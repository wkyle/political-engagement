LIABILITIES AND ACTIONS






Liability of 
acceptor


11. The acceptor of a depository bill is liable 
to provide the clearing house to which it is 
payable with funds so that the clearing house 
can pay, on the depository bill's due date and 
in accordance with its terms, the participants 
who have an interest in the depository bill.







Liability of 
drawer


12. If a depository bill is dishonoured by the 
acceptor, the drawer is liable to pay the 
amount of the depository bill to the clearing 
house to which it is payable.







Liability of 
endorser of 
depository bill


13. If a depository bill is dishonoured by the 
drawer and acceptor, every endorser is jointly 
and severally liable to pay the amount of the 
depository bill to the clearing house to which 
it is payable.







Liability of 
maker


14. The maker of a depository note is liable 
to provide the clearing house to which it is 
payable with funds so that the clearing house 
can pay, on the depository note's due date or 
dates, the principal amount of the depository 
note, and the interest payable by its terms, to 
the participants who have an interest in the 
depository note.







Liability of 
endorser of 
depository 
note


15. If a depository note is dishonoured by 
the maker, every endorser is jointly and 
severally liable to pay the principal amount of 
the depository note, and the interest payable 
by its terms, to the clearing house to which it 
is payable.







Liability in 
absence of 
contract


16. A party is liable to pay in accordance 
with sections 11 to 15 whether or not the 
depository bill or note constitutes a binding 
contractual obligation.







Discharge of 
liability


17. A party who is liable to pay in 
accordance with sections 11 to 15 and who 
makes final and irrevocable payment of the 
amounts owing to the clearing house on the 
depository bill's or note's due date or dates is 
discharged of that liability to pay.







Duty of 
clearing house


18. (1) A clearing house must enforce the 
payment of a depository bill or note payable to 
it and it must do so for the account and benefit 
and at the expense of each participant who has 
an interest in the depository bill or note.







Exception


(2) A clearing house need not enforce the 
payment of a depository bill or note if its 
contract of membership with its participants 
provides that it is not required to do so or that 
the duty to enforce is conditional on the 
fulfilment of conditions specified in the 
contract and those conditions have not been 
fulfilled.







Action in 
name of 
clearing house


(3) If a clearing house that is required to 
enforce the payment of a depository bill or 
note does not do so within a reasonable time, 
any participant who has an interest in the 
depository bill or note may bring an action in 
the name of the clearing house.







No beneficial 
interest


19. A clearing house has no beneficial 
interest in a depository bill or note by reason 
only of the fact that the depository bill or note 
is payable to it, but nothing in this Act 
precludes the clearing house from acquiring, 
in its own right, a depository bill or note or any 
interest in a depository bill or note.







No defences


20. (1) A clearing house holds a depository 
bill or note payable to it, and any money 
received as payment of principal or interest 
with respect to the depository bill or note, free 
from any defence that affects the depository 
bill or note or any defence that affects the 
liability of any party to it, except a defence 
that










(a) the signature of the party liable to pay it 
is forged or unauthorized; or









(b) the depository bill or note is counterfeit 
or has been materially altered without the 
consent of the party liable to pay it.






Participants


(2) Subsection (1) applies to a participant 
who brings an action in the name of a clearing 
house in accordance with subsection 18(3).
