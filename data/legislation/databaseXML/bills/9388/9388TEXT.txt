breath where 
reasonable 
belief of

(3.1) Where a peace officer believes on 
reasonable and probable grounds that a 
person, at any time within the preceding four 
hours, has committed an offence under 
paragraph 249(1)(a) and thereby caused the 
death of any other person, the peace officer 
shall, by demand made to that person 
forthwith or as soon as practicable, require 
that person to provide as soon thereafter as is 
practicable such samples of the urine of the 
person as in the opinion of a qualified 
technician are necessary to enable a proper 
analysis to be made in order to determine the 
presence, if any, of drugs in the person's urine, 
and










(a) such samples of the person's breath as in 
the opinion of a qualified technician, or









(b) where the peace officer has reasonable 
and probable grounds to believe that, by 
reason of any physical condition of the 
person,









(i) the person may be incapable of 
providing a sample of his breath, or









(ii) it would be impracticable to obtain a 
sample of the person's breath,









such samples of the person's blood, under 
the conditions referred to in subsection (4), 
as in the opinion of the qualified medical 
practitioner or qualified technician taking 
the samples are necessary to enable proper 
analysis to be made in order to determine 
the concentration, if any, of alcohol in the 
person's blood, and to accompany the peace 
officer for the purpose of enabling the 
samples to be taken.  









(2) Subsection 254(4) of the Act is 
replaced by the following:







Exception


(4) Samples of blood may only be taken 
from a person pursuant to a demand made by 
a peace officer under subsection (3) or (3.1)  if

of a qualified medical practitioner and the 
qualified medical practitioner is satisfied that 
the taking of those samples would not 
endanger the life or health of the person.










(3) Subsection 254(6) of the Act is 
replaced by the following:







Only one 
conviction for 
failure to 
comply with 
demand

telecommunication, that there are reasonable 
grounds to believe that










(a) a person has, within the preceding four 
hours, committed an offence under 
paragraph 249(1)(a) and thereby caused the 
death of another person, and









(b) a qualified medical practitioner is of the 
opinion that









(i) by reason of any physical or mental 
condition of the person, the person is 
unable to consent to the taking of samples 
of his blood, and









(ii) the taking of samples of blood from 
the person would not endanger the life or 
health of the person,









the justice may issue a warrant authorizing a 
peace officer to require a qualified medical 
practitioner to take, or to cause to be taken by 
a qualified technician under the direction of 
the qualified medical practitioner, such 
samples of the blood of the person as in the 
opinion of the person taking the samples are

if any, of alcohol in his blood.

amended by adding the following after
