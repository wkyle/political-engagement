The House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-476









An Act to provide for improved information 
on the cost of proposed government 
programs







Preamble


 Whereas insufficient information is given 
on the public cost of government programs;










 And whereas the public needs information 
on the estimated cost of a government 
program in order to have an informed opinion 
of it;










Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:










 






Short title


1. This Act may be cited as the Program 
Cost Declaration Act.







Program cost 
declaration


2. (1) Where a new program that will be 
funded from public money is to be 
implemented, the minister of the Crown who 
will be responsible for the program shall










(a) at the time of introducing a bill in 
Parliament that authorizes the program, if it 
is to be authorized by an Act, or









(b) at the time the minister or the Governor 
in Council issues the regulation, order or 
other instrument that authorizes the 
program, if it is to be authorized by a 
regulation, order or other instrument,









forthwith make a declaration of the estimated 
annual cost of the program in each of the first 
five years of its intended operation, expressed 
as a total cost and as a cost per capita for every 
resident of Canada.







Publication


(2) The declaration mentioned in 
subsection (1) shall within five days be










(a) laid before the House of Commons, if it 
is sitting at the time; or









(b) published in the Canada Gazette, sent to 
every member of the House of Commons 
and released in a statement to the media, if 
the House of Commons is not sitting at the 
time.






Auditor 
General's 
opinion


(3) The Auditor General of Canada shall










(a) at the time the declaration is made, if 
time is available, or









(b) if time is not available, as soon as 
possible thereafter,









provide to the minister of the Crown 
responsible for the program an opinion that 
the method of calculation of the costs referred 
to in subsection (1) is valid and that the cost is 
a good estimate or, if the Auditor General 
dissents from that opinion, the reasons for the 
dissent, and the minister shall forthwith make 
the opinion public in the manner described in 
subsection (2).







Publication


(4) The minister of the Crown who is 
responsible for a program shall ensure that the 
costs referred to in subsection (1) are clearly 
and publicly displayed at every place under 
the jurisdiction of or contracted to the 
Government of Canada at which the program 
is delivered and in every document in which 
the minister or a person acting with the 
authority of the minister undertakes to deliver 
to any person a good or service under the 
program.
