time limit

request would make the time limit 
impracticable to meet; or

to be able to convert the personal 
information into an alternative format.









In either case, the organization shall, no later 
than thirty days after the date of the request,

about the individual, the organization shall 
sever the information about the third party 
before giving the individual access.

life, health or security is threatened.

may be
