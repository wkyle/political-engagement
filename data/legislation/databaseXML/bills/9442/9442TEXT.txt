The House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-454









An Act to provide for the recognition of the 
Canadian Horse as the national horse of 
Canada







Preamble


 Whereas the Canadian Horse was 
introduced into Canada in 1665, when the 
King of France sent horses from his own 
stables to the people of his North American 
colony;










 Whereas the Canadian Horse increased in 
number during the ensuing century to become 
an invaluable ally to the settlers in their efforts 
to survive and prosper in their new home;










 Whereas all Canadians who have known 
the Canadian Horse have made clear their high 
esteem for the qualities of great strength and 
endurance, resilience, intelligence and good 
temper that distinguish the breed;










 Whereas the Canadian Horse was at one 
time in danger of being lost through 
interbreeding or as a casualty of war, but has 
survived these perils;










 Whereas, since 1885 and all during the 
present century, widespread and increasingly 
successful efforts have been made to 
re-establish and preserve the Canadian Horse;










 And Whereas the Government of Canada 
wishes to recognize the unique place of the 
Canadian Horse in the history of Canada;










Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:
