BILL C-514









An Act to protect human health and the 
environment by reducing automotive 
pollution







Preamble


 Whereas there is a growing body of 
scientific evidence that human health and the 
environment are harmed or may be harmed by 
gasoline containing Methylcyclopentadienyl 
manganese tricarbonyl and by gasoline and 
diesel fuel containing less than a specified 
amount of oxygen;










 Whereas the Government of Canada 
committed itself at the United Nations 
Conference on Environment and 
Development in 1992 to applying the 
precautionary principle;










 And Whereas on the basis of the 
precautionary principle, it is imperative for 
the Parliament of Canada to take immediate 
action to protect human health and the 
environment by banning these harmful or 
potentially harmful automotive fuels;










Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:
