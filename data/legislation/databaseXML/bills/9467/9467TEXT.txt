The House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-519









An Act to limit the imposition of tolls on

Her Majesty, by and with the advice and 
consent of the Senate and House of Commons 
of Canada, enacts as follows:






Short title


1. This Act may be cited as the Highway 
Tolls Act.







No tolls on 
publicly 
funded 
highways


2. (1) Notwithstanding any other Act of 
Parliament, no payment for any part of any 
public highway, bridge or tunnel may be paid 
from or guaranteed as a charge against the 
Consolidated Revenue Fund, either for initial 
construction or in subsequent improvement, 
addition, re-routing, maintenance or repair, if 
such payment or guarantee would have the 
result that more than five percent of the 
aggregate of all payments made from, or 
guarantees charged against, the public funds 
of Canada or a province on or after January 1, 
1990 for the highway, bridge or tunnel are or 
were a charge or liability on the Consolidated 
Revenue Fund, unless the government or 
person that will administer the highway, 
bridge or tunnel enters into an undertaking 
that it will not impose any toll or other charge 
for use of the highway, bridge or tunnel by the 
public at any time during the twenty years 
following the payment or guarantee.







Determi-
nation by 
Auditor 
General


(2) Where any question arises as to whether 
a payment or guarantee will require an 
undertaking under subsection (1), the matter 
shall be determined by the Auditor General for 
Canada, and the determination shall be con
clusive and not subject to appeal.
