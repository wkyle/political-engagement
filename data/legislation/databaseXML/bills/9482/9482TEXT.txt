Her Majesty, by and with the advice and 
consent of the Senate and House of Commons 
of Canada, enacts as follows:









1. The Divorce Act is amended by adding 
the following immediately after the heading 
preceding section 16:







Order for joint 
custody


15.4 (1) Subject to subsections (2) to (5), 
where a court of competent jurisdiction, on 
application, makes an order respecting the 
custody of a child of the marriage, the order 
shall grant custody of the child to both spouses 
jointly.







Other order


(2) The court may, on application by either 
or both spouses or any other person, make an 
order respecting any or all children of the 
marriage that is different from the order 
provided for in subsection (1) where, in the 
opinion of the court, the best interests of the 
child or children so require.







Application 
by other 
person


(3) A person, other than a spouse, may not 
make an application under subsection (1) or 
(2) without leave of the court.







Arrangement


(4) In proceedings under this section, where 
the spouses have entered into an arrangement 
respecting the custody of a child that is 
different from the joint custody provided for in 
subsection (1), the court may










(a) make an order giving effect to the 
arrangement; or









(b) where, in its opinion, the arrangement is 
detrimental to the child, make any other 
order that it believes is in the best interests 
of the child.






Abuse or 
neglect


(5) Where the court finds, on application by 
one of the spouses or by any other person, that 
a child of the marriage has suffered neglect, 
abuse or other mistreatment by one of the 
spouses, the court may make an order 
respecting the custody of the child that it 
believes is in the best interests of the child.







Terms and 
conditions


(6) The court may make an order under this 
section that is different from the order 
provided for in subsection (1) for a definite or 
indefinite period or until the happening of a 
specified event and may impose such other 
terms, conditions or restrictions in connection 
therewith as it thinks fit and just.







Order 
respecting 
change of 
residence


(7) Without limiting the generality of 
subsection (6), the court may include in an 
order under this section a term requiring any 
person who has custody of a child of the 
marriage and who intends to change the place 
of residence of that child to notify, at least 
thirty days before the change or within such 
other period before the change as the court 
may specify, any person who is granted access 
to that child of the change, the time at which 
the change will be made and the new place of 
residence of the child.







Factors


(8) In making an order under this section, 
the court










(a) shall take into consideration only the 
best interests of the child of the marriage as 
determined by reference to the condition, 
means, needs and other circumstances of 
the child;









(b) shall not take into consideration the past 
conduct of any person unless the conduct is 
relevant to the ability of that person to act 
as a parent of a child; and









(c) shall give effect to the principle that a 
child of the marriage should have as much 
contact with each spouse as is consistent 
with the best interests of the child and, for 
that purpose, shall take into consideration 
the willingness of the person for whom 
custody is sought to facilitate such contact.  









2. (1) Subsections 16(1) and (2) of the Act 
are replaced by the following:







Access


16. (1) A court of competent jurisdiction 
may, on application by either or both spouses 
or by any other person, make an order 
respecting access to any or all children of the 
marriage.







Interim order 
for custody


(2) Where an application is made under 
subsection (1), the court may, on application 
by either or both spouses or by any other 
person, make an interim order respecting the 
custody of or the access to, or the custody of 
and access to, any or all children of the 
marriage pending determination of the 
application under subsection (1) or under 
subsection 15.4(2) or (5) .










(2) Subsection 16(4) of the Act is replaced 
by the following:







Joint access


(4) The court may make an order under this 
section granting access to any or all children 
of the marriage to any one or more persons.
