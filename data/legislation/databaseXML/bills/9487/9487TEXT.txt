The House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-481









An Act providing for equal treatment for 
persons cohabiting in a relationship 
similar to a conjugal relationship







Preamble


 Whereas the Constitution of Canada 
provides that every individual is equal before 
and under the law and has the right to the equal 
protection and benefit of the law without 
discrimination;










 Whereas the Government of Canada 
already recognizes the diversity of Canadians 
as regards race, national or ethnic origin, 
colour and religion as a fundamental 
characteristic of Canadian society;










 Whereas the Government of Canada is 
working to achieve the equality of all 
Canadians in the economic, social, cultural 
and political life of Canada;










 Whereas the Government of Canada 
recognizes the importance of the 
contributions of homosexuals and lesbians to 
the cultural, social, economic and political 
enrichment of Canada;










 Whereas homosexuals and lesbians in 
Canada constitute a minority that is frequently 
exposed to discrimination;










 Whereas the discrimination experienced 
by the homosexual minority in Canada is in 
many respects similar to that experienced by 
other minorities in Canada, particularly by 
visible and ethnic minorities;










 Whereas in recent years some Acts of 
Parliament have granted the same benefits as 
those granted to married persons to 
heterosexual couples cohabiting in 
relationships similar to conjugal 
relationships;










 Whereas the lives of homosexual and 
lesbian couples in Canada who cohabit in 
relationships similar to conjugal relationships 
are in many respects identical to the lives of 
heterosexual couples;










 Whereas homosexual and lesbian couples 
cohabiting in relationships similar to conjugal 
relationships do not at present receive the 
same benefits as those accorded heterosexual 
couples cohabiting in relationships similar to 
conjugal relationships;










 And Whereas the Government of Canada 
wishes to end discrimination in Acts of 
Parliament against homosexual and lesbian 
couples by granting the individuals in such 
couples the same benefits as those received by 
heterosexual couples cohabiting in 
relationships similar to conjugal 
relationships;










 Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with 
the advice and consent of the Senate and 
House of Commons of Canada, enacts as 
follows:
