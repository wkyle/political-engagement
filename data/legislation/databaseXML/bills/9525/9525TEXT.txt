BILL C-515









An Act to provide for a referendum to

Preamble


Whereas Parliament has not determined

medically unnecessary abortions should be 
paid for with federal funds;










 Whereas it remains a matter of national 
debate as to whether such funding should be 
made available; and










 Whereas it is in the public interest to 
determine by referendum whether the Canada 
Health Act should be amended to provide that 
fiscal transfers to provinces that allow funding 
for such abortions will be reduced;










Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:
