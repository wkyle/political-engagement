samples of 
blood


3. A person may apply to a justice for a 
warrant authorizing the taking of a sample of 
blood from another person, in order to 
determine whether that person carries a 
designated virus, where the applicant believes 
on reasonable grounds that










(a) the applicant has come into contact with 
a bodily substance of the other person while 
engaged in the performance of a designated 
function in relation to the other person, or

the person believing that the life of the other 
person was in danger, or that the other 
person had suffered or was about to suffer 
physical injury;









(b) by reason of the circumstances in which 
the applicant came into contact with the 
bodily substance, the applicant may have 
been infected by a designated virus; and









(c) by reason of the lengthy incubation 
periods for diseases caused by the 
designated viruses and the methods 
available for ascertaining the presence of 
such viruses in the human body, an analysis 
of the applicant's blood would not 
accurately determine, in a timely manner,

opinion of the person taking the samples are 
necessary to enable a proper analysis to be 
made in order to determine whether the person 
carries a designated virus, where the justice is 
satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to 
believe that










(a) the applicant came into contact with a 
bodily substance of the other person while 
the applicant was performing a designated 
function in relation to the other person, or 
the applicant was assisting or attempting to 
assist the other person believing that the life 
of the other person was in danger, or that the 
other person had suffered or was about to 
suffer physical injury;









(b) by reason of the circumstances in which 
the applicant came into contact with the 
bodily substance, the applicant may have 
been infected by a designated virus;









(c) by reason of the lengthy incubation 
periods for diseases caused by the

accurately determine, in a timely manner, 
whether the applicant had been infected by 
a designated virus that might have been 
present in the bodily substance with which 
the applicant came into contact; and









(d) a qualified medical practitioner is of the 
opinion that the taking of blood samples 
from the person would not endanger the life 
or health of the person.
