2nd Session, 36th Parliament,
48 Elizabeth II, 1999










The House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-270









An Act to protect persons accused of a crime 
from undue public speculation and 
suspicion before guilt has been 
established







Preamble


 Whereas it is a fundamental principle of 
justice that an accused person is presumed 
innocent until found to be guilty by a proper 
judicial process;










 Whereas publication of the fact that a 
person has been charged with committing a 
crime inevitably causes public speculation 
that may amount to an unjustified 
presumption of guilt;










 Whereas the law already provides 
protection from undue publicity for certain 
witnesses, complainants and young offenders 
in order to protect their interests and that there 
should also be protection for those who are 
accused but not convicted of an offence;










 Whereas Parliament considers that a 
restriction on the right to publish details of a 
criminal charge or trial in such a way as to 
identify an accused before the matter has been 
determined is a reasonable limit on the 
freedom of expression guaranteed by the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
that is demonstrably justified in a free and 
democratic society as necessary to maintain 
the principle of presumption of innocence;










Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:










 









1. The Criminal Code is amended by 
adding the following after section 533:










PART XVII.1 PUBLICATION PRIOR TO 
CONVICTION






Publication 
delay


534.1 (1) Subject to this section, no person 
shall publish by any means any report










(a) of an offence under this Act alleged to 
have been committed by any person,









(b) of a warrant for the arrest or search of the 
property of or the detention of any person, 
or









(c) of any court application, hearing, 
preliminary hearing, trial or disposition 
concerning a person alleged to have 
committed an offence,









in which the name of the person or any 
information serving to identify the person is 
disclosed, until the person has been found 
guilty of the offence or has been acquitted of 
the offence by a court of competent 
jurisdiction.







Exception


(2) Subsection (1) does not apply if a judge, 
on application orders that such information 
may be published, having being satisfied that 
it is in the public interest to do so because










(a) there are reasonable grounds to believe 
the person is avoiding arrest;









(b) the person has escaped from lawful 
custody; or









(c) the person has breached the conditions 
of an order for judicial interim release.






Adminis-
tration of 
justice


(3) For greater certainty, subsection (1) 
does not apply in respect of the disclosure of 
information in the course of the 
administration of justice, including the 
disclosure of information for the purposes of 
the investigation of an offence or the purposes 
of Part III of this Act, or the Firearms Act 
where it is not the purpose of the disclosure to 
make the information known in the 
community.







Appeals


(4) For greater certainty, subsection (1) 
does not apply to an appeal of a conviction or 
acquittal.
