responsible fiscal management specified in 
subsection (2).







Principles 
defined


(2) The principles of responsible fiscal 
management are










(a) to reduce the total Crown debt to prudent 
levels so as to provide a buffer against 
factors that may impact adversely on the 
level of total Crown debt in the future by 
ensuring that, until such levels have been 
achieved, the total operating expenses of 
the Crown in each fiscal year are less than 
the total operating revenues of the Crown in 
the same fiscal year;

have been achieved, to maintain them by 
ensuring that, on average, over a reasonable 
period of time, the total operating expenses 
of the Crown do not exceed its total 
operating revenues;









(c) to achieve and maintain levels of Crown 
net worth that provide a buffer against 
factors that may impact adversely on the 
Crown's net worth in the future;









(d) to manage prudently the fiscal risks 
facing the Crown; and









(e) to pursue policies that are consistent 
with a reasonable degree of predictability 
respecting the level and stability of tax rates 
for future years.

from 
principles


(3) The Government may depart from the 
principles of responsible fiscal management 
specified in subsection (2), but when the 
Government does so

Government expects to return to those 
principles.
