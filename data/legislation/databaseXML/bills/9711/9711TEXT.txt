``Minister'', except in section 44.1, means the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage .







Regulations


2. In any instrument made under the 
Copyright Act, every reference to the 
Minister of Industry shall be read as a 
reference to the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage unless the context otherwise 
requires.







Employees


3. (1) Nothing in this Act shall be 
construed as affecting the status of an 
employee who, immediately before the 
coming into force of this Act, was 
responsible for the administration of the 
Copyright Act and occupied a position in the 
Department of Industry, except that the 
employee shall, on the coming into force of 
this Act, occupy their position in the 
Department of Canadian Heritage under 
the authority of the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage.







Definition of 
``employee''


(2) In this section, ``employee'' has the 
same meaning as in subsection 2(1) of the

tions

charges and expenses of the public service 
of Canada within the Department of 
Industry, relating to the administration of 
the Copyright Act, and that, on the day on 
which this Act comes into force, is 
unexpended, is deemed, on that day, to be 
an amount appropriated for defraying the 
charges and expenses of the Department of 
Canadian Heritage.
