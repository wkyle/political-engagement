1. Section 3 of the Immigration Act is 
amended by adding the following after 
paragraph (f):










(f.1) to provide for the deportation of any 
person in Canada who is a landed 
immigrant or seeking immigrant status and 
who is convicted of a serious criminal 
offence in Canada;  









2. The Act is amended by adding the 
following after section 32.1:







Definition of 
``serious 
criminal 
offence''


32.2 (1) In this section and in paragraph 
3(f.1), ``serious criminal offence'' means an 
offence under the Criminal Code, or any other 
Act, for which a person, if convicted, may be 
sentenced to a term of imprisonment of seven 
years or more.







Order for 
removal


(2) A court that convicts a person who is in 
Canada as a landed immigrant or seeking 
landing as an immigrant of a serious criminal 
offence shall, on the application of the Crown, 
or may, on its own motion, order, in addition 
to any other punishment imposed, that the 
person be removed from Canada.







Powers of 
court


(3) For the purposes of subsection (2), the 
court may order the exercise of any power that 
may be exercised by the Minister or any other 
person under this Act in respect of deportation 
or removal.







Hearing


(4) An order for removal on the motion of 
the court shall be considered forthwith on 
sentencing the person convicted and the 
person shall have the right to be heard on the 
question of whether the order should issue.







Appeal


(5) An order for removal from Canada may 
be appealed in the same manner as the 
sentence or conviction for the serious criminal 
offence may be appealed, but is not otherwise 
subject to any appeal or other procedure under 
this or any other Act.
