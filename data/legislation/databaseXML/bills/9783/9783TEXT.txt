BILL C-380









An Act to amend the Bills of Exchange Act 
(definitions of ``infant'' and ``minor'')







Preamble


 Whereas, on November 20, 1989, the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child was 
adopted by the United Nations General 
Assembly;










 Whereas the Convention was ratified by 
Canada on December 31, 1991;










 And Whereas the Convention proposes a 
definition of ``child'' that should be applied 
uniformly throughout federal legislation and 
the words ``infant'' and ``minor'' also need 
consistent definitions;
