Competition Act are replaced by the 
following:

only or primarily to certain customers, or to 
refrain from selling to a competitor, with 
the object of preventing a competitor's 
entry into, or expansion in, a market;









(i) selling articles at a price lower than the 
acquisition cost for the purpose of 
disciplining or eliminating a competitor;









(j) requiring a supplier to pay a fee to a 
retailer as a condition for selling a product, 
if the fee is unrelated to, or in excess of, the 
actual costs incurred by the retailer with 
respect to the product for the purpose of 
impeding or preventing a supplier's entry 
into or expansion in a market;









(k) squeezing, by a vertically integrated 
retailer, of the margin available to an 
unintegrated person competing with the 
retailer, for the purpose of impeding or 
preventing the person's entry into, or 
expansion in a market; and









(l) unilaterally withholding amounts owing 
to a supplier for some purported reason 
without the prior agreement of the supplier 
for the purpose of disciplining the supplier.
