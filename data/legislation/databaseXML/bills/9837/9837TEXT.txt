CHAPTER 26











An Act to give effect to the requirement for 
clarity as set out in the opinion of the 
Supreme Court of Canada in the Quebec 
Secession Reference










[Assented to 29th June, 2000] 







Preamble


 Whereas the Supreme Court of Canada has 
confirmed that there is no right, under 
international law or under the Constitution of 
Canada, for the National Assembly, 
legislature or government of Quebec to effect 
the secession of Quebec from Canada 
unilaterally;










 Whereas any proposal relating to the 
break-up of a democratic state is a matter of 
the utmost gravity and is of fundamental 
importance to all of its citizens;










 Whereas the government of any province 
of Canada is entitled to consult its population 
by referendum on any issue and is entitled to 
formulate the wording of its referendum 
question;










 Whereas the Supreme Court of Canada has 
determined that the result of a referendum on 
the secession of a province from Canada must 
be free of ambiguity both in terms of the 
question asked and in terms of the support it 
achieves if that result is to be taken as an 
expression of the democratic will that would 
give rise to an obligation to enter into 
negotiations that might lead to secession;










 Whereas the Supreme Court of Canada has 
stated that democracy means more than 
simple majority rule, that a clear majority in 
favour of secession would be required to 
create an obligation to negotiate secession, 
and that a qualitative evaluation is required to 
determine whether a clear majority in favour 
of secession exists in the circumstances;










 Whereas the Supreme Court of Canada has 
confirmed that, in Canada, the secession of a 
province, to be lawful, would require an 
amendment to the Constitution of Canada, 
that such an amendment would perforce 
require negotiations in relation to secession 
involving at least the governments of all of the 
provinces and the Government of Canada, and 
that those negotiations would be governed by 
the principles of federalism, democracy, 
constitutionalism and the rule of law, and the 
protection of minorities;










 Whereas, in light of the finding by the 
Supreme Court of Canada that it would be for 
elected representatives to determine what 
constitutes a clear question and what 
constitutes a clear majority in a referendum 
held in a province on secession, the House of 
Commons, as the only political institution 
elected to represent all Canadians, has an 
important role in identifying what constitutes 
a clear question and a clear majority sufficient 
for the Government of Canada to enter into 
negotiations in relation to the secession of a 
province from Canada;










 And Whereas it is incumbent on the 
Government of Canada not to enter into 
negotiations that might lead to the secession of 
a province from Canada, and that could 
consequently entail the termination of 
citizenship and other rights that Canadian 
citizens resident in the province enjoy as full 
participants in Canada, unless the population 
of that province has clearly expressed its 
democratic will that the province secede from 
Canada;










Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:










 






House of 
Commons to 
consider 
question


1. (1) The House of Commons shall, within 
thirty days after the government of a province 
tables in its legislative assembly or otherwise 
officially releases the question that it intends 
to submit to its voters in a referendum relating 
to the proposed secession of the province from 
Canada, consider the question and, by 
resolution, set out its determination on 
whether the question is clear.







Extension of 
time


(2) Where the thirty days referred to in 
subsection (1) occur, in whole or in part, 
during a general election of members to serve 
in the House of Commons, the thirty days shall 
be extended by an additional forty days.







Considera-
tions


(3) In considering the clarity of a 
referendum question, the House of Commons 
shall consider whether the question would 
result in a clear expression of the will of the 
population of a province on whether the 
province should cease to be part of Canada and 
become an independent state.







Where no 
clear 
expression of 
will


(4) For the purpose of subsection (3), a clear 
expression of the will of the population of a 
province that the province cease to be part of 
Canada could not result from










(a) a referendum question that merely 
focuses on a mandate to negotiate without 
soliciting a direct expression of the will of 
the population of that province on whether 
the province should cease to be part of 
Canada; or









(b) a referendum question that envisages 
other possibilities in addition to the 
secession of the province from Canada, 
such as economic or political arrangements 
with Canada, that obscure a direct 
expression of the will of the population of 
that province on whether the province 
should cease to be part of Canada.






Other views to 
be considered


(5) In considering the clarity of a 
referendum question, the House of Commons 
shall take into account the views of all 
political parties represented in the legislative 
assembly of the province whose government 
is proposing the referendum on secession, any 
formal statements or resolutions by the 
government or legislative assembly of any 
province or territory of Canada, any formal 
statements or resolutions by the Senate, any 
formal statements or resolutions by the 
representatives of the Aboriginal peoples of 
Canada, especially those in the province 
whose government is proposing the 
referendum on secession, and any other views 
it considers to be relevant.







No 
negotiations if 
question not 
clear


(6) The Government of Canada shall not 
enter into negotiations on the terms on which 
a province might cease to be part of Canada if 
the House of Commons determines, pursuant 
to this section, that a referendum question is 
not clear and, for that reason, would not result 
in a clear expression of the will of the 
population of that province on whether the 
province should cease to be part of Canada.







House of 
Commons to 
consider 
whether there 
is a clear will 
to secede


2. (1) Where the government of a province, 
following a referendum relating to the 
secession of the province from Canada, seeks 
to enter into negotiations on the terms on 
which that province might cease to be part of 
Canada, the House of Commons shall, except 
where it has determined pursuant to section 1 
that a referendum question is not clear, 
consider and, by resolution, set out its 
determination on whether, in the 
circumstances, there has been a clear 
expression of a will by a clear majority of the 
population of that province that the province 
cease to be part of Canada.







Factors for 
House of 
Commons to 
take into 
account


(2) In considering whether there has been a 
clear expression of a will by a clear majority 
of the population of a province that the 
province cease to be part of Canada, the House 
of Commons shall take into account










(a) the size of the majority of valid votes 
cast in favour of the secessionist option;









(b) the percentage of eligible voters voting 
in the referendum; and









(c) any other matters or circumstances it 
considers to be relevant.






Other views to 
be considered


(3) In considering whether there has been a 
clear expression of a will by a clear majority 
of the population of a province that the 
province cease to be part of Canada, the House 
of Commons shall take into account the views 
of all political parties represented in the 
legislative assembly of the province whose 
government proposed the referendum on 
secession, any formal statements or 
resolutions by the government or legislative 
assembly of any province or territory of 
Canada, any formal statements or resolutions 
by the Senate, any formal statements or 
resolutions by the representatives of the 
Aboriginal peoples of Canada, especially 
those in the province whose government 
proposed the referendum on secession, and 
any other views it considers to be relevant.







No 
negotiations 
unless will 
clear


(4) The Government of Canada shall not 
enter into negotiations on the terms on which 
a province might cease to be part of Canada 
unless the House of Commons determines, 
pursuant to this section, that there has been a 
clear expression of a will by a clear majority 
of the population of that province that the 
province cease to be part of Canada.







Constitu-
tional 
amendments


3. (1) It is recognized that there is no right 
under the Constitution of Canada to effect the 
secession of a province from Canada 
unilaterally and that, therefore, an amendment 
to the Constitution of Canada would be 
required for any province to secede from 
Canada, which in turn would require 
negotiations involving at least the 
governments of all of the provinces and the 
Government of Canada.







Limitation


(2) No Minister of the Crown shall propose 
a constitutional amendment to effect the 
secession of a province from Canada unless 
the Government of Canada has addressed, in 
its negotiations, the terms of secession that are 
relevant in the circumstances, including the 
division of assets and liabilities, any changes 
to the borders of the province, the rights, 
interests and territorial claims of the 
Aboriginal peoples of Canada, and the 
protection of minority rights.
