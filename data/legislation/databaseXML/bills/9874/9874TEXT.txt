2nd Session, 36th Parliament,
48-49 Elizabeth II, 1999-2000










The House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-434









An Act to amend the Department of Health 
Act (genetically modified food)







1996, c. 8


Her Majesty, by and with the advice and 
consent of the Senate and House of Commons 
of Canada, enacts as follows:









1. The Department of Health Act is 
amended by adding the following after 
section 4:







Genetically 
modified 
foods


4.1 (1) The Minister is responsible










(a) subject to subsection (2), for conduct 
research in order to









(i) establish whether the consumption by 
a human being or an animal of 
genetically modified foods produces, in 
the short term and in the long term, 
dangerous or harmful effects on their 
health, and









(ii) establish whether the cultivation of 
plants from genetically modified seeds 
produces, in the short term and in the long 
term, dangerous or harmful effects on the 
environment, insects and other plants;









(b) subject to subsection (3), to make 
regulations on the labelling of genetically 
modified foods in order to allow consumers 
to easily identify that characteristic of the 
food;









(c) to create a committee responsible for









(i) examining whether the research 
conducted for the purpose of creating 
genetically modified foods and the 
consumption by a human being of such 
foods causes ethic problems or goes 
against certain religious practices and, if 
so, to make such recommendations as the 
committee deems useful in the 
circumstances,









(ii) encouraging all groups, including the 
academic community, to engage in a 
debate on the matters referred to in 
sub-paragraph (i), and









(iii) reporting to the Minister on its 
findings and recommendations; and









(d) to set up information programs for the 
general public to make people aware









(i) of the short term and long term effects 
of the consumption of genetically 
modified foods on the health of human 
beings and animals; and









(ii) of the short term and long term effects 
of the cultivation of plants from 
genetically modified seeds on the 
environment, insects and other plants.






For greater 
certainty


(2) For greater certainty, a review of the 
information relating to a novel food 
performed under Division 28 of the Food and 
Drug Regulations (C.R.C., c. 870) made 
under the Food and Drugs Act is not research 
for the purposes of paragraph (1)(a).







Consultation


(3) The regulations referred to in subsection 
(1) shall be made after consultation by the 
Minister with representatives of consumers 
groups that he considers it useful to consult.
