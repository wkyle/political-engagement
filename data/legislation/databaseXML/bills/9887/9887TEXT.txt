Her Majesty, by and with the advice and

1. (1) Paragraph 33(1)(b) of the 
Competition Act is replaced by the 
following:










(b) in the case of an offence under section 
52.1 or 52.2 , if the offence is committed or 
continued,









(i) injury to competition will result, or









(ii) one or more persons are likely to 
suffer damage from the commission of 
the offence that will be substantially 
greater than any damage that persons 
named in the application are likely to 
suffer from an injunction issued under 
this subsection in the event that it is 
subsequently found that an offence under 
section 52.1 or, as the case may be, under 
section 52.2  has not been committed, 
was not about to be committed and was 
not likely to be committed.









(2) Section 33 of the Act is amended by 
adding the following after subsection (1.1):







Contest, 
lottery or 
game of 
chance


(1.2) An injunction issued in respect of an 
offence under section 52.2 may forbid any 
person from supplying to another person a 
product that is or is likely to be used for the 
commission or continuation of such an 
offence, where the person being supplied or, in 
the case of a corporation, any of its officers or 
directors, was previously










(a) convicted of an offence under section 
52.2 or an offence under section 52 in 
respect of conduct prohibited by section 
52.2; or









(b) punished for the contravention of an 
order made under this section or section 34 
in respect of the commission, continuation 
or repetition of an offence referred to in 
paragraph (a).  









2. The Act is amended by adding the 
following after section 52.1:







Contest, 
lottery or 
game of 
chance


52.2 (1) Subject to subsection (2), no person 
shall distribute or cause to be distributed 
printed material containing a contest, lottery, 
game of chance or game of mixed chance and 
skill whose contents convey the general 
impression that the recipient of the printed 
material has won a prize or advantage, and the 
distribution of such prize or advantage or any 
request for information regarding them is 
conditional on the prior payment of a sum of 
money or specific telephone charges.







For greater 
certainty


(2) Where the printed material indicates 
that it is necessary to make a telephone call in 
order to obtain information regarding the 
prizes to be won or how to obtain them and 
specific charges apply to the telephone call, 
such charges are deemed to be specific 
telephone charges for the purposes of 
subsection (1).







Due diligence


(3) No person shall be convicted of an 
offence under this section who establishes that 
the person exercised due diligence to prevent 
the commission of the offence.







Offences by 
employees or 
agents


(4) Notwithstanding subsection (3), in the 
prosecution of a corporation for an offence 
under this section, it is sufficient proof of the 
offence to establish that it was committed by 
an employee or agent of the corporation, 
whether or not the employee or agent is 
identified, unless the corporation establishes 
that the corporation exercised due diligence to 
prevent the commission of the offence.







Liability of 
officers and 
directors


(5) Where a corporation commits an 
offence under this section, any officer or 
director of the corporation who is in a position 
to direct or influence the policies of the 
corporation in respect of conduct prohibited 
by this section is a party to and guilty of the 
offence and is liable to the punishment 
provided for the offence, whether or not the 
corporation has been prosecuted or convicted, 
unless the officer or director establishes that 
the officer or director exercised due diligence 
to prevent the commission of the offence.







Offence and 
punishment


(6) Any person who contravenes subsection 
(1) is guilty of an offence and liable










(a) on conviction on indictment, to a fine in 
the discretion of the court or to imprison
ment for a term not exceeding five years, or 
to both; or









(b) on summary conviction, to a fine not 
exceeding $200,000 or to imprisonment for 
a term not exceeding one year, or to both.

by the following:

55.1 or 66, in the Federal Court - Trial

prosecution or other proceedings, the Federal 
Court - Trial Division has all the powers and

committee of the House of Commons, of the 
Senate or of both Houses of Parliament as

this Act and shall, within one year after the
