International 
agreements


7. The Minister, with the approval of the 
Governor in Council, may enter into an 
agreement with the government of a foreign 
state or with an international organization for 
the purposes of this Act.







Federal-provi
n-
cial 
agreements


8. (1) The Minister, with the approval of the 
Governor in Council, may enter into an 
agreement with the government of any 
province for the purposes of this Act. The 
Minister must publish, once a year, a list of the 
federal-provincial agreements that are in 
force.







Consistency 
with 
agreement


(2) Subject to subsection (3) but despite the 
other provisions of this Act, the selection of 
foreign nationals, sponsorship and 
authorizations for foreign nationals to enter 
and remain in Canada under this Act, and any 
regulations that are made with respect to those 
matters, must be consistent with the 
federal-provincial agreements.







Inadmissi-
bility not 
limited


(3) Subsection (2) is not to be construed to 
limit the application of any provision of this 
Act concerning inadmissibility to Canada.







Sole 
provincial 
responsibility 
- permanent 
residents


9. (1) The following rules apply in respect 
of a foreign national who is a member of a 
class for which a province has sole selection 
responsibility under a federal-provincial 
agreement and who intends to reside in that 
province as a permanent resident, unless the 
agreement provides otherwise:










(a) the foreign national, unless inadmissible 
under this Act, is to be authorized to enter 
and remain in Canada as a permanent 
resident if the foreign national meets the 
selection criteria of the province;









(b) the foreign national is not to be 
authorized to enter and remain in Canada as 
a permanent resident if the foreign national 
does not meet the selection criteria of the 
province or, in the case of an authorization 
under subsection 22(1), without the consent 
of the province;









(c) an authorization for the foreign national 
to enter and remain in Canada as a 
permanent resident under this Act is subject 
to the provisions of the law of the province 
governing









(i) the number of foreign nationals who 
may settle in the province as permanent 
residents, whether that number is an 
estimate or a maximum, and









(ii) the distribution of that number among 
classes of foreign nationals; and









(d) conditions that may be attached, in 
accordance with the law of the province, to 
an authorization for the foreign national to 
enter and remain in Canada as a permanent 
resident have the same force and effect as if 
they were made under this Act.






Sole 
provincial 
responsibility 
- appeals


(2) If a federal-provincial agreement gives 
a province sole responsibility to establish and 
apply financial criteria with respect to 
undertakings that sponsors living in that 
province may make in order to allow a foreign 
national to enter and remain as a permanent 
resident, then, unless the agreement provides 
otherwise, the existence of a right of appeal 
under the law of that province respecting 
rejections by provincial officials of 
applications for sponsorship, for reasons of 
failing to meet financial criteria or to comply 
with a prior undertaking, prevents the sponsor, 
except on humanitarian and compassionate 
grounds, from appealing under this Act 
against a refusal, based on those reasons, to 
issue a visa or to authorize the foreign national 
to enter and remain in Canada as a permanent 
resident.







Consulta-
tions with the 
provinces


10. (1) The Minister may consult with the 
governments of the provinces on immigration 
and refugee protection policies and programs, 
in order to facilitate cooperation and to take 
into consideration the effects that the 
implementation of this Act may have on the 
provinces.







Required 
consultations


(2) The Minister must consult with the 
governments of the provinces respecting the 
number of foreign nationals in each class to 
whom it is planned to grant permanent 
resident status each year, their distribution in 
Canada taking into account regional 
economic and demographic requirements, 
and the measures to be undertaken to facilitate 
their integration into Canadian society.
