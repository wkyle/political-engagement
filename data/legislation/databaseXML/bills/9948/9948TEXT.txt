(1.1) In order that a province may qualify 
for a full cash contribution referred to in 
section 14 for a fiscal year, the laws of the 
province must provide for a program that 
requires persons who receive social assistance 
to do work assigned to them by the province 
during every month for which they receive the 
assistance, subject to such reasonable 
exceptions as are provided by those laws 
granting full or partial exemption from the 
requirement to work on the grounds of










(a) physical or mental disability;









(b) pregnancy beyond a stage specified by 
law;









(c) an obligation to care for a dependant 
person on a part-time or full-time basis on 
the grounds of that other person's age or 
disability;









(d) being engaged in a training program 
established by or pursuant to the laws of the 
province designed to assist persons to find 
employment or make them better able to 
manage their lives; and









(e) a need to have the opportunity to seek 
employment.









2. Section 21 of the Act is amended by 
adding the following after subsection (1):







Provincial 
laws not 
complying


(1.1) Where a referral of a matter under 
section 20 is made on the grounds that the laws 
of a province do not or have ceased to comply 
with subsection 19(1.1), by the beginning of a 
fiscal year that commences after January 1, 
2001, the Governor in Council shall, by order, 
direct that the cash contribution to the 
province for a fiscal year be reduced by the 
amount the province has provided for the 
payment of social assistance for the fiscal 
year, or the amount that, in the opinion of the 
Minister, the province will spend on social 
assistance for the fiscal year.







Non-
compliance in 
prior fiscal 
year


(1.2) Where a referral of a matter under 
section 20 is made on the grounds that a 
province received a cash contribution without 
deduction in respect of non-compliance with 
subsection 19(1.1), in respect of a particular 
fiscal year that commences after January 1, 
2001, but the Minister is of the opinion that the 
province did not comply with that subsection 
19(1.1) for all or a part of that particular fiscal 
year, the Governor in Council shall, by order, 
direct that the cash contribution to the 
province for the following fiscal year be 
reduced by the amount that, in the opinion of 
the Minister, the province spent on social 
assistance for the particular fiscal year, or the 
part of the year that the province did not 
comply with subsection 19(1.1), whichever is 
the case.
