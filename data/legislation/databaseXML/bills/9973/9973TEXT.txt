1st Session, 37th Parliament,
49-50 Elizabeth II, 










House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-230









An Act to amend the Business Development 
Bank of Canada Act and the Canada 
Student Loans Act to provide for a 
student loan system that is more 
supportive of students







Preamble













 Whereas the management of student loan 
programs by chartered banks has resulted in 
unreasonable and inflexible interest and pay
ment policies and had a negative effect on 
post-secondary education in Canada;










 Whereas student loans through chartered 
banks have had interest rates applied that are 
well over the rates charges to business borrow
ers;










 Whereas, as a result, many graduates face 
years with a heavy burden of loan repayment 
after completing their education and conse
quently many graduates are unable to meet 
their loan obligations;










 And Whereas student loan programs 
should incorporate interest policies that rec
ognize that giving financial assistance to stu
dents is a national priority of investment in the 
future and not an opportunity for profit;










Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:







1995, c. 28
