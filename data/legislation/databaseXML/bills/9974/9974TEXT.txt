BILL C-203









An Act to amend the Bankruptcy and 
Insolvency Act (unpaid wages to rank 
first in priority in distribution)










Her Majesty, by and with the advice and 
consent of the Senate and House of Commons 
of Canada, enacts as follows:









1. Section 124 of the Bankruptcy and 
Insolvency Act is amended by adding the 
following after subsection (1):







Proof of claim 
for wages etc


(1.1) Notwithstanding subsection (1) the 
trustee shall, before distributing the proceeds 
realized from the property of a bankrupt, make 
reasonable enquiries to determine whether all 
proofs of claim have been submitted in respect 
of the matters mentioned in subsection 
136(0.1).  










2. Section 136 of the Act is amended by 
adding the following before subsection (1):







Priority of 
claims for 
wages, 
salaries, 
commissions 
etc


(0.1) Prior to settlement of claims of 
secured creditors in respect of security taken 
or granted after the date on which this 
subsection comes into force, and any claims 
described in subsection (1), the proceeds 
realized from the property of a bankrupt shall 
be first applied to the unpaid wages, salaries, 
commissions, compensation or payments in 
respect of pensions or other benefits of any 
clerk, servant, travelling salesman, labourer 
or workman in respect of services rendered to 
the bankrupt during the six months 
immediately preceding the bankruptcy to the 
extent of ten thousand dollars in each case, 
together with, in the case of a travelling 
salesman, disbursements properly incurred by 
that salesman in and about the bankrupt's 
business, to the extent of an additional four 
thousand dollars in each case, during the same 
period, and those wages, salaries, 
commissions, compensation, payments and 
disbursements are deemed to be a first charge 
on every realizable asset of the bankrupt.







When 
payments 
deemed due


(0.2) For the purposes of subsection (0.1),










(a) commissions payable when goods are 
shipped, delivered or paid for, if shipped, 
delivered or paid for within the six month 
period, shall be deemed to have been earned 
therein; and









(b) notwithstanding any provision of any 
contract or agreement under which a person 
is employed, wages, salaries, other 
compensation and payments in respect of 
pension and other benefits are deemed to 
have been earned hour by hour, and the 
trustee shall, with the approval of the court, 
determine the portion of any compensation 
normally calculated by or payable on the 
expiry of a week, month, year or any other 
period exceeding an hour, that had been 
earned at the time of bankruptcy.






Wage priority 
notwithstand-
ing other Acts


(0.3) Subsection (0.1) operates 
notwithstanding any other provision of this or 
any other Act of Parliament or of the 
legislature of a province, and no secured 
creditor shall take or disburse the proceeds of 
realization of any property on which the 
creditor holds security unless the creditor first 
sets aside, in the manner satisfactory to the 
trustee and approved by the court,










(a) such proportion that the trustee orders 
and the court approves of the total of all 
amounts that are proven in respect of the 
matters mentioned in subsection (0.1); or









(b) a sum that the trustee has estimated, and 
the court has approved, as sufficient to pay 
claims that are likely to be proven under 
subsection (0.1).






Renewed 
security


(0.4) Security that is renewed and that, but 
for the renewal, would expire, is deemed for 
the purpose of subsection (0.1) to have been 
taken or granted on the date of its renewal.  










3. (1) The portion of subsection 136(1) of 
the Act before paragraph (a) is replaced by 
the following:

and  the rights of secured creditors, the 
proceeds realized from the property of a 
bankrupt shall be applied in priority of 
payment as follows:
