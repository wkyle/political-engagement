Her Majesty, by and with the advice and 
consent of the Senate and House of Commons 
of Canada, enacts as follows:






1996, c. 23


EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE ACT









1. (1) Subsection 2(5) of the Employment 
Insurance Act is replaced by the following:







Weeks of 
benefits paid


(5) For the purposes of subsection 7(4.1) 
and section 145, the Commission may, with 
the approval of the Governor in Council, make 
regulations for establishing how many weeks 
of benefits a claimant was paid, in order to 
take into account benefit reductions or 
deductions in the calculation or payment of 
those benefits.










(2) Regulations made under subsection 
2(5) of the Act, as enacted by subsection (1), 
may, if they so provide, have effect with 
respect to any period before the 
commencement of this subsection.










2. Subsection 3(2) of the Act is replaced 
by the following:







Report


(2) The Commission shall report to the 
Minister on its assessment annually from 2001 
to 2006, no later than March 31 following the 
end of each of those years. The Commission 
shall make any additional reports at any other 
times, as the Minister may request.










3. (1) Section 4 of the Act is replaced by 
the following:







Maximum 
yearly 
insurable 
earnings


4. (1) For the purposes of subsection 
14(1.1), section 17, subsection 82(2) and 
sections 95 and 145, the maximum yearly 
insurable earnings is $39,000 until the amount 
calculated in accordance with subsection (2) 
for a year, before rounding down under 
subsection (4), exceeds $39,000, in which 
case the maximum yearly insurable earnings 
for that year is that amount, rounded down 
under subsection (4).







Calculation of 
amount


(2) The amount referred to in subsection (1) 
is the amount equal to 52 times the product 
obtained by multiplying










(a) the average for the twelve month period 
ending on June 30 in the preceding year of 
the Average Weekly Earnings for each 
month in that period









by










(b) the ratio that the average for the twelve 
month period ending on June 30 in that 
preceding year of the Average Weekly 
Earnings for each month in that twelve 
month period bears to the average for the 
twelve month period ending twelve months 
prior to June 30 of that preceding year of the 
Average Weekly Earnings for each month 
in that twelve month period ending twelve 
months prior to June 30 of that preceding 
year.






Subsequent 
years


(3) For years subsequent to the year in 
which the maximum yearly insurable earnings 
exceeds $39,000, before rounding down under 
subsection (4), the maximum yearly insurable 
earnings is the maximum yearly insurable 
earnings for the preceding year, before 
rounding down under subsection (4), 
multiplied by the ratio that the average for the 
twelve month period ending on June 30 in that 
preceding year of the Average Weekly 
Earnings for each month in that twelve month 
period bears to the average for the twelve 
month period ending twelve months prior to 
June 30 of that preceding year of the Average 
Weekly Earnings for each month in that 
twelve month period ending twelve months 
prior to June 30 of that preceding year.







Rounding 
down


(4) If the amount calculated in accordance 
with subsection (2) or (3) is not a multiple of 
one hundred dollars, the amount of the 
maximum yearly insurable earnings is 
rounded down to the nearest multiple of one 
hundred dollars.







Average 
Weekly 
Earnings


(5) The Average Weekly Earnings for a 
month is the average weekly earnings of the 
Industrial Aggregate in Canada for the month 
as published by Statistics Canada under the 
authority of the Statistics Act.










(2) Section 4 of the Act, as enacted by 
subsection (1), applies in respect of the year 
2002 and subsequent years.










4. (1) Section 7 of the Act is amended by 
adding the following after subsection (4):

or a re-entrant if the person has been paid one

tion under

the claimant was not qualified, or to which the 
claimant was not entitled, as a result of the 
repeal of section 15 of the Employment 
Insurance Act, as enacted by section 5 of this

amount of that money and the claimant is not 
liable to repay that amount under section 43 of
