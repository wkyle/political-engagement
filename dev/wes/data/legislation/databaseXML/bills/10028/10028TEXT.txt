An Act to amend the Corrections and

Her Majesty, by and with the advice and 
consent of the Senate and House of Commons 
of Canada, enacts as follows:






1995, c. 42, 
ss. 37 and 
69(g)(E)


1. Section 123 of the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act is amended by 
adding the following after subsection (7):







Withdrawal of 
application


(8) If an offender referred to in subsection 
(1) who has applied for a review for full parole 
or who has been notified that the Board 
intends to carry out a review for full parole of 
the offender










(a) withdraws the application made under 
this section and the regulations pursuant to 
subsection (7), or









(b) advises the Board pursuant to subsection 
(2) of a wish not to be considered for full 
parole,









and the withdrawal or giving of advice, as the 
case may be, is made after the later of










(c) the day that is the midpoint between the 
date set for the review and the date the 
offender is notified of that date, and









(d) the day sixty days before the date set for 
the review,









the Board shall not review the offender for full 
parole until two years after the date of the 
withdrawal or advice, as the case may be.







Exception


(9) Subsection (8) does not apply if the 
withdrawal or advice was, in the opinion of the 
Board, justifiable on the basis of the illness, 
mental or physical capacity of the offender or 
other cause beyond the offender's control that 
could materially affect the review.
