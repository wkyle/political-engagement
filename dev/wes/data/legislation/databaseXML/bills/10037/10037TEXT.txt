CHAPTER 1 









[Assented to 19th February, 2002] 












An Act in respect of criminal justice for young 
persons and to amend and repeal other 
Acts







Preamble


WHEREAS members of society share a 
responsibility to address the developmental 
challenges and the needs of young persons and 
to guide them into adulthood;










WHEREAS communities, families, parents 
and others concerned with the development of 
young persons should, through 
multi-disciplinary approaches, take 
reasonable steps to prevent youth crime by 
addressing its underlying causes, to respond to 
the needs of young persons, and to provide 
guidance and support to those at risk of 
committing crimes;










WHEREAS information about youth justice, 
youth crime and the effectiveness of measures 
taken to address youth crime should be 
publicly available;










WHEREAS Canada is a party to the United 
Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child 
and recognizes that young persons have rights 
and freedoms, including those stated in the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
and the Canadian Bill of Rights, and have 
special guarantees of their rights and 
freedoms;










AND WHEREAS Canadian society should 
have a youth criminal justice system that 
commands respect, takes into account the 
interests of victims, fosters responsibility and 
ensures accountability through meaningful 
consequences and effective rehabilitation and 
reintegration, and that reserves its most 
serious intervention for the most serious 
crimes and reduces the over-reliance on 
incarceration for non-violent young persons;










NOW, THEREFORE, Her Majesty, by and 
with the advice and consent of the Senate and 
House of Commons of Canada, enacts as 
follows:

DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLE






Policy for 
Canada with 
respect to 
young persons


3. (1) The following principles apply in this 
Act:










(a) the youth criminal justice system is 
intended to









(i) prevent crime by addressing the 
circumstances underlying a young 
person's offending behaviour,









(ii) rehabilitate young persons who 
commit offences and reintegrate them 
into society, and









(iii) ensure that a young person is subject 
to meaningful consequences for his or 
her offence









in order to promote the long-term 
protection of the public;









(b) the criminal justice system for young 
persons must be separate from that of adults 
and emphasize the following:









(i) rehabilitation and reintegration,









(ii) fair and proportionate accountability 
that is consistent with the greater 
dependency of young persons and their 
reduced level of maturity,









(iii) enhanced procedural protection to 
ensure that young persons are treated 
fairly and that their rights, including their 
right to privacy, are protected,









(iv) timely intervention that reinforces 
the link between the offending behaviour 
and its consequences, and









(v) the promptness and speed with which 
persons responsible for enforcing this 
Act must act, given young persons' 
perception of time;









(c) within the limits of fair and 
proportionate accountability, the measures 
taken against young persons who commit 
offences should









(i) reinforce respect for societal values,









(ii) encourage the repair of harm done to 
victims and the community,









(iii) be meaningful for the individual 
young person given his or her needs and 
level of development and, where 
appropriate, involve the parents, the 
extended family, the community and 
social or other agencies in the young 
person's rehabilitation and reintegration, 
and









(iv) respect gender, ethnic, cultural and 
linguistic differences and respond to the 
needs of aboriginal young persons and of 
young persons with special 
requirements; and









(d) special considerations apply in respect 
of proceedings against young persons and, 
in particular,









(i) young persons have rights and 
freedoms in their own right, such as a 
right to be heard in the course of and to 
participate in the processes, other than 
the decision to prosecute, that lead to 
decisions that affect them, and young 
persons have special guarantees of their 
rights and freedoms,









(ii) victims should be treated with 
courtesy, compassion and respect for 
their dignity and privacy and should 
suffer the minimum degree of 
inconvenience as a result of their 
involvement with the youth criminal 
justice system,









(iii) victims should be provided with 
information about the proceedings and 
given an opportunity to participate and 
be heard, and









(iv) parents should be informed of 
measures or proceedings involving their 
children and encouraged to support them 
in addressing their offending behaviour.






Act to be 
liberally 
construed


(2) This Act shall be liberally construed so 
as to ensure that young persons are dealt with 
in accordance with the principles set out in 
subsection (1).
