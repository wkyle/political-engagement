1st Session, 37th Parliament,
49-50 Elizabeth II, 










House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-252






1992, c. 20


An Act to amend the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act (statutory 
release granted only when earned and 
subject to mandatory supervision)







Preamble













 Whereas the primary object of the criminal 
justice system is to protect law-abiding 
citizens and ensure that, so far as possible, 
imprisoned offenders are not released early 
into the community unless they are 
rehabilitated;










 Whereas imprisoned offenders have to 
participate in the rehabilitation process and 
should bear the burden of establishing that the 
necessary degree of rehabilitation has been 
achieved before being granted statutory 
release;










 And Whereas the public interest must be 
protected by keeping offenders who are 
granted statutory release under mandatory 
supervision;










Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:







1997, c. 17, s. 
17


1. (1) The definition of ``statutory 
release'' in subsection 99(1) of the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act is 
replaced by the following:







``statutory 
release''
« libération 
d'office »


``statutory release'' means release from 
imprisonment before the expiration of an 
offender's sentence subject to mandatory  
supervision, that is earned by  an offender 
pursuant to  section 127;










(2) Paragraph 99(2)(a) of the Act is 
replaced by the following:










(a) any period during which the offender 
could earn the right  to statutory release; or






1999, c. 31, s. 
66(E)


2. Subsection 127(1) of the Act is replaced 
by the following:







Earned 
statutory 
release


127. (1) Subject to any provision of this Act, 
an offender sentenced, committed or 
transferred to a penitentiary may apply for 
statutory release  on the date determined in 
accordance with this section in order, subject 
to subsection 128(1.1) , to remain at large 
under supervision  until the expiration of the 
sentence according to law.







Offender to 
show 
suitability for 
release


(1.1) An offender who applies for statutory 
release shall satisfy the Board during a hearing 
at which the offender is present that the 
offender










(a) has been rehabilitated to an extent that 
statutory release subject to mandatory 
supervision order would not constitute a 
threat to public safety in general nor to any 
specific person or group of persons; and









(b) has not shown behaviour that raises 
reasonable doubt that the offender would 
comply with a mandatory supervision order 
referred to in subsection 128(1.1).






Right to 
re-apply


(1.2) If an offender making an application 
fails to satisfy the Board of the matters 
mentioned in paragraphs (1.1)(a) and (b) and 
is refused statutory release, the offender may 
make a further application, no sooner than 180 
days after the hearing on the prior application, 
if the institutional head of the facility at which 
the offender is confined first reports to the 
Board in writing that the staff with particular 
responsibility for the offender are of the 
opinion that the offender has made significant 
improvement with respect to the matters 
mentioned in those paragraphs since the prior 
hearing.  







1999, c. 18, s. 
87


3. (1) Section 128 of the Act is amended by 
adding the following after subsection (1):







Mandatory 
supervision


(1.1) An offender who is granted statutory 
release shall be subject to a mandatory 
supervision order until the expiration of the 
full period of the sentence.







Amended 
supervision 
order


(1.2) The Board may amend the terms of the 
mandatory supervision order that applies to an 
offender who has been granted statutory 
release so as to make the terms










(a) more strict if that is warranted by 
considerations of public safety or the 
rehabilitation of the offender; or









(b) less strict if that is warranted by the 
behaviour of the offender during a period of 
statutory release.  









(2) Subsection 128(2) of the Act is 
replaced by the following:







Freedom to be 
at large


(2) Except to the extent required by the 
conditions of any day parole and the terms of 
the order for mandatory supervision of any 
statutory release , an offender who is released 
on parole, statutory release or unescorted 
temporary absence is entitled, subject to this 
Part, to remain at large in accordance with the 
conditions of the parole, statutory release or 
unescorted temporary absence and is not 
liable to be returned to custody by reason of 
the sentence unless the parole, statutory 
release, mandatory supervision order  or 
unescorted temporary absence is suspended, 
cancelled, terminated or revoked.
