1st Session, 37th Parliament,
49-50 Elizabeth II, 2001 










House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-266









An Act to amend the Marriage (Prohibited 
Degrees) Act in order to protect the legal 
definition of marriage by invoking 
section 33 of the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms







Preamble


Whereas marriage, as defined between one 
man and one woman, has from time 
immemorial been firmly grounded in our legal 
tradition, one that is itself a reflection of long 
standing community values;










 Whereas the preservation of marriage as an 
institution is a matter of deep public concern 
and interest to the Canadian public, for it is the 
foundation of family and society;










 Whereas the solemnization of marriage 
honours these principles;










 And Whereas the people of Canada wish to 
provide and protect a legal definition of 
marriage that will not be challenged in the 
courts under the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms;










Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:
