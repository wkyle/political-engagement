AGREEMENTS






International 
agreements


7. The Minister, with the approval of the 
Governor in Council, may enter into an 
agreement with the government of a foreign 
state or with an international organization for 
the purposes of this Act.







Federal-provi
ncial

Governor in Council, may enter into an 
agreement with the government of any 
province for the purposes of this Act. The 
Minister must publish, once a year, a list of the 
federal-provincial agreements that are in 
force.







Consistency 
with 
agreement


(2) Subject to subsection (3) but despite the 
other provisions of this Act, the following 
must be consistent with the federal-provincial 
agreements:










(a) the selection and sponsorship of, and the 
acquisition of status by, foreign nationals 
under this Act; and









(b) regulations governing those matters, 
including regulations respecting the 
examination in Canada of applications to 
become a permanent resident, or respecting 
the foreign nationals who may be selected 
on the basis of an investment in Canada.






Inadmissibi-
lity not 
limited


(3) Subsection (2) is not to be interpreted as 
limiting the application of any provision of 
this Act concerning inadmissibility to Canada.







Sole 
provincial 
responsibi-
lity - 
permanent 
residents


9. (1) Where a province has, under a 
federal-provincial agreement, sole 
responsibility for the selection of a foreign 
national who intends to reside in that province 
as a permanent resident, the following 
provisions apply to that foreign national, 
unless the agreement provides otherwise:










(a) the foreign national, unless inadmissible 
under this Act, shall be granted permanent 
resident status if the foreign national meets 
the province's selection criteria;









(b) the foreign national shall not be granted 
permanent resident status if the foreign 
national does not meet the province's 
selection criteria;









(c) the foreign national shall not be granted 
permanent resident status contrary to the 
provisions of the law of the province 
governing the number of foreign nationals 
who may settle in the province as 
permanent residents, whether that number 
is an estimate or a maximum, or governing 
the distribution of that number among 
classes of foreign nationals; and









(d) conditions imposed in accordance with 
the law of the province have the same force 
and effect as if they were made under this 
Act, if they are imposed on a foreign 
national on or before the grant of permanent 
resident status.






Sole 
provincial 
responsibi-
lity - appeals


(2) If a federal-provincial agreement gives 
a province sole responsibility to establish and 
apply financial criteria with respect to 
undertakings that sponsors living in that 
province may make in respect of a foreign 
national who applies to become a permanent 
resident, then, unless the agreement provides 
otherwise, the existence of a right of appeal 
under the law of that province respecting 
rejections by provincial officials of 
applications for sponsorship, for reasons of 
failing to meet financial criteria or failing to 
comply with a prior undertaking, prevents the 
sponsor, except on humanitarian and 
compassionate grounds, from appealing under 
this Act against a refusal, based on those 
reasons, of a visa or permanent resident status.







Consulta-
tions with the 
provinces


10. (1) The Minister may consult with the 
governments of the provinces on immigration 
and refugee protection policies and programs, 
in order to facilitate cooperation and to take 
into consideration the effects that the 
implementation of this Act may have on the 
provinces.







Required 
consultations


(2) The Minister must consult with the 
governments of the provinces respecting the 
number of foreign nationals in each class who 
will become permanent residents each year, 
their distribution in Canada taking into 
account regional economic and demographic 
requirements, and the measures to be 
undertaken to facilitate their integration into 
Canadian society.
