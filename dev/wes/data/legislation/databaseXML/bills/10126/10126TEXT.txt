SUMMARY









The purpose of this enactment is to reduce the inclusion rate on 
United States social security payments received by Canadian taxpayers 
from 85% to 50%.










The ``inclusion rate'' is the percentage of United States social 
security payments that is to be included as income by a Canadian 
taxpayer. The Canada-United States Tax Convention Act, 1984 
provides for 15% of such payments to be non-taxable in the hands of 
Canadian residents, which would result in an 85% inclusion rate.










This enactment provides that a further 35% of United States Social 
Security payments are not included in taxable income. This 35% is in 
addition to the 15% that is to be exempt from Canadian tax under the 
Convention and the enactment therefore increases the exemption to 
50% and decreases the inclusion rate to 50%.
