1st Session, 37th Parliament,
49-50 Elizabeth II, 2001 










House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-385









An Act to facilitate micro credit for 
self-sufficiency







Preamble


 Whereas Canada's financial institutions 
hold a special position in Canada's financial 
sector and, in view of this position and the 
historic profitability of their business, they 
should be able to contribute more to the 
country's growth by giving more guidance, 
services and credit to the smaller and less well 
established entrepreneur and to those who are 
unemployed or who have low or inconsistent 
incomes; and










 Whereas such people need extra financial, 
guidance and support in order to be able to 
manage their financial positions and develop 
self-sufficiency and security; and










 Whereas some cooperatives and other 
organizations already offer micro credit and 
some service organizations have worked to 
obtain financial services from financial 
institutions for the persons to whom they 
provide services, but much more is needed; 
and










 Whereas Parliament is of the opinion that 
a government initiative to encourage a greater 
role by financial institutions in micro credit 
and a recognition of those institutions that are 
active in the micro credit sector would be 
effective;










Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:
