1st Session, 37th Parliament,
49-50 Elizabeth II, 2001 










House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-









An Act respecting the creation of sanctuaries 
for endangered species of wildlife







Preamble


Whereas Canada's endangered wildlife are 
a part of our national heritage and it is 
essential and for the benefit of all of Canada 
to take all possible steps to assist them to 
recover;










 Whereas some of our endangered species 
are rare, endangered or extirpated in other 
parts of the world which makes their 
protection in Canada even more essential;










 Whereas, in most cases, preservation of 
suitable habitat is the most important element 
for the recovery of an endangered species;










 And Whereas it is the opinion of 
Parliament that in many cases suitable habitat 
may be secured for protection by agreement 
and voluntary action by the owner of the land, 
in appropriate cases supported by monetary 
compensation or the grant of land or an 
interest in land as compensation, but that it 
may be necessary to expropriate land in 
extreme cases and such action should be 
provided for;










Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:










 






Short title


1. This Act may be cited as the Endangered

(a) is natural to Canada,









(b) in the past has had a stable or growing 
population in Canada,









(c) has suffered a reduction in population 
that, if not reversed, may result in 
extirpation or extinction, and









(d) may recover its population to a level at 
which the threat of extirpation or extinction 
will be reduced or removed if suitable 
habitat for the species is set aside and 
protected,









the Minister shall recommend to the Governor 
in Council that the species be designated as an 
endangered species.







Idem


(2) Where the Minister has received a report 
from COSEWIC that states that, on the basis

species and the land is federal land, the 
Minister may in consultation with the minister 
of the Crown who is responsible for the 
administration of the land, establish a 
sanctuary on the land for the purpose of 
affording the species sufficient habitat in 
Canada to recover.







Habitat on 
provincial
