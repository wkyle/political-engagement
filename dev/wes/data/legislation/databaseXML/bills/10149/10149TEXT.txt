where a particular qualifying person has 
agreed to sell or issue securities of the 
particular qualifying person (or of a qualifying

and









(b) where a taxpayer acquires, at the same 
time, two or more identical securities under 
circumstances to which either subsection

securities were made.






Disposition of 
newly-acquire
d security


(1.31) Where a taxpayer acquires, at a 
particular time, a particular security under an 
agreement referred to in subsection (1) and, on 
a day that is no later than 30 days after the day

securities'', respectively),









(4) Paragraph 7(1.4)(d) of the Act is

(b) the taxpayer receives no consideration 
for the disposition or exchange of the 
exchanged securities other than securities 
(in this subsection referred to as the ``new 
securities'') of









(i) the particular qualifying person,









(ii) a qualifying person with which the 
particular qualifying person does not deal 
at arm's length immediately after the

particular time one or more particular 
amounts in respect of rights of the taxpayer to 
acquire securities under an agreement referred 
to in subsection (1) ceasing to be exercisable 
in accordance with the terms of the agreement, 
and the cessation would not, if this Act were 
read without reference to this subsection, 
constitute a transfer or disposition of those 
rights by the taxpayer,










(a) the taxpayer is deemed to have disposed 
of those rights at the particular time to a 
person with whom the taxpayer was dealing 
at arm's length and to have received the 
particular amounts as consideration for the

to acquire those rights equal to the amount, 
if any, by which

acquire those rights (determined without 
reference to this subsection)









exceeds









(ii) the total of all amounts each of which 
is an amount received by the taxpayer 
before the particular time in respect of 
the cessation.

(8) Where a particular qualifying person 
(other than a Canadian-controlled private 
corporation) has agreed to sell or issue 
securities of the particular qualifying person 
(or of a qualifying person with which it does 
not deal at arm's length) to a taxpayer who is 
an employee of the particular qualifying 
person (or of a qualifying person with which 
the particular qualifying person does not deal 
at arm's length), in applying paragraph (1)(a) 
in respect of the taxpayer's acquisition of a 
security under the agreement, the reference in 
that paragraph to ``the taxation year in which 
the employee acquired the securities'' shall be 
read as a reference to ``the taxation year in 
which the employee disposed of or exchanged 
the securities'' if










(a) the acquisition is a qualifying 
acquisition; and









(b) the taxpayer elects, in accordance with 
subsection (10), to have this subsection 
apply in respect of the acquisition.






Meaning of 
``qualifying 
acquisition''


(9) For the purpose of subsection (8), a 
taxpayer's acquisition of a security under an 
agreement made by a particular qualifying 
person is a qualifying acquisition if










(a) the acquisition occurs after February 27, 
2000;









(b) the taxpayer would, if this Act were read 
without reference to subsection (8), be 
entitled to deduct an amount under 
paragraph 110(1)(d) in respect of the 
acquisition in computing income for the 
taxation year in which the security is 
acquired;









(c) where the particular qualifying person is 
a corporation, the taxpayer was not, at the 
time immediately after the agreement was 
made, a person who would, if the references 
in the portion of the definition ``specified 
shareholder'' in subsection 248(1) before 
paragraph (a) to ``in a taxation year'' and 
``at any time in the year'' were read as 
references to ``at any time'' and ``at that 
time'', respectively, be a specified 
shareholder of any of









(i) the particular qualifying person,









(ii) any qualifying person that, at that 
time, was an employer of the taxpayer 
and was not dealing at arm's length with 
the particular qualifying person, and









(iii) the qualifying person of which the 
taxpayer had, under the agreement, a 
right to acquire a security; and









(d) where the security is a share,









(i) it is of a class of shares that, at the time 
the acquisition occurs, is listed on a 
prescribed stock exchange, and









(ii) where rights under the agreement 
were acquired by the taxpayer as a result 
of one or more dispositions to which 
subsection (1.4) applied, none of the 
rights that were the subject of any of the 
dispositions included a right to acquire a 
share of a class of shares that, at the time 
the rights were disposed of, was not listed 
on any prescribed stock exchange.






Election for 
the purpose of 
subsection (8)


(10) For the purpose of subsection (8), a 
taxpayer's election to have that subsection 
apply in respect of the taxpayer's acquisition 
of a particular security under an agreement 
referred to in subsection (1) is in accordance 
with this subsection if










(a) the election is filed, in the prescribed 
form and manner at a particular time that is 
before January 16 of the year following the 
year in which the acquisition occurs, with a 
person who would be required to file an 
information return in respect of the 
acquisition if subsection (8) were read 
without reference to paragraph (8)(b);









(b) the taxpayer is resident in Canada at the 
time the acquisition occurs; and









(c) the specified value of the particular 
security does not exceed the amount by 
which









(i) $100,000









exceeds









(ii) the total of all amounts each of which 
is the specified value of another security 
acquired by the taxpayer at or before the 
particular time under an agreement 
referred to in subsection (1), where









(A) the taxpayer's right to acquire that 
other security first became exercisable 
in the year that the taxpayer's right to 
acquire the particular security first 
became exercisable, and









(B) at or before the particular time, the 
taxpayer has elected in accordance 
with this subsection to have subsection 
(8) apply in respect of the acquisition 
of that other security.






Meaning of 
``specified 
value''


(11) For the purpose of paragraph (10)(c), 
the specified value of a particular security 
acquired by a taxpayer under an agreement 
referred to in subsection (1) is the amount 
determined by the formula










A/B










where










A	is the fair market value, determined at the 
time the agreement was made, of a 
security that was the subject of the 
agreement at the time the agreement was 
made; and










B	is










(a) except where paragraph (b) applies, 1, 
and









(b) where the number or type of securities 
that are the subject of the agreement has 
been modified in any way after the time 
the agreement was made, the number of 
securities (including any fraction of a 
security) that it is reasonable to consider 
the taxpayer would, at the time the 
particular security was acquired, have a 
right to acquire under the agreement in 
lieu of one of the securities that was the 
subject of the agreement at the time the 
agreement was made.






Identical 
options - 
order of 
exercise


(12) Unless the context otherwise requires, 
a taxpayer is deemed to exercise identical 
rights to acquire securities under agreements 
referred to in subsection (1)










(a) where the taxpayer has designated an 
order, in the order so designated; and









(b) in any other case, in the order in which 
those rights first became exercisable and, in 
the case of identical rights that first became 
exercisable at the same time, in the order in 
which the agreements under which those 
rights were acquired were made.






Revoked 
election


(13) For the purposes of this section (other 
than this subsection), an election filed by a 
taxpayer to have subsection (8) apply to the 
taxpayer's acquisition of a security is deemed 
never to have been filed if, before January 16 
of the year following the year in which the 
acquisition occurs, the taxpayer files with the 
person with whom the election was filed a 
written revocation of the election.







Deferral 
deemed valid


(14) For the purposes of this section and 
paragraph 110(1)(d), where a taxpayer files an 
election to have subsection (8) apply in 
respect of the taxpayer's acquisition of a 
particular security and subsection (8) would 
not apply to the acquisition if this section were 
read without reference to this subsection, the 
following rules apply if the Minister so 
notifies the taxpayer in writing:










(a) the acquisition is deemed, for the 
purpose of subsection (8), to be a qualifying 
acquisition;









(b) the taxpayer is deemed to have elected, 
in accordance with subsection (10), at the 
time of the acquisition, to have subsection 
(8) apply in respect of the acquisition; and









(c) if, at the time the Minister sends the 
notice, the taxpayer has not disposed of the 
security, the taxpayer is deemed (other than 
for the purpose of subsection (1.5)) to have 
disposed of the security at that time and to 
have acquired the security immediately 
after that time other than under an 
agreement referred to in subsection (1).
