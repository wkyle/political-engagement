House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-311









An Act to provide for the recognition of the 
Canadien Horse as the national horse of 
Canada







Preamble


 Whereas the Canadien Horse was 
introduced into Canada in 1665, when the 
King of France sent horses from his own 
stables to the people of his North American 
colony;










 Whereas the Canadien Horse increased in 
number during the ensuing century to become 
an invaluable ally to the settlers in their efforts 
to survive and prosper in their new home;










 Whereas all Canadians who have known 
the Canadien Horse have made clear their 
high esteem for the qualities of great strength 
and endurance, resilience, intelligence and 
good temper that distinguish the breed;










 Whereas the Canadien Horse was at one 
time in danger of being lost through 
interbreeding or as a casualty of war, but has 
survived these perils;










 Whereas, since 1885 and all during the 
present century, widespread and increasingly 
successful efforts have been made to 
re-establish and preserve the Canadien Horse;










 And Whereas the Government of Canada 
wishes to recognize the unique place of the 
Canadien Horse in the history of Canada;










Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:
