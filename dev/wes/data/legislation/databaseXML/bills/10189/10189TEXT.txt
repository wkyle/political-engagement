House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-363









An Act to Prevent Deficit Budgets










Her Majesty, by and with the advice and 
consent of the Senate and House of Commons 
of Canada, enacts as follows:






Short title


1. This Act may be cited as the Deficit 
Prevention Act.







Interpreta-
tion


2. The following definitions apply in this 
Act.







``Crown''
« Sa 
Majesté »


``Crown'' means Her Majesty in right of 
Canada.







``debt''
« dette »


``debt'' means the accrued total debt of the 
Crown.







``deficit''
« déficit »


``deficit'' means an excess of expenditure 
over revenue in a fiscal year.







``expenses''
« dépenses »


``expenses'' means the expenses recorded in 
the financial statements of the government.







Limit on 
deficit


3. Subject to section 6, no deficit shall be 
incurred by the Crown in any fiscal year 
commencing on or after April 1, 2002.







Balanced 
budget with 
contingency 
reserve


4. For every fiscal year the Minister shall 
present to Parliament a budget that shows a 
surplus after providing as an estimated 
expenditure a contingency reserve in 
accordance with section 5.







Contingency 
reserve


5. (1) In every fiscal year that commences 
on or after April 1, 2002, every budget 
presented to Parliament must include an 
expenditure estimate in the form of a 
contingency reserve of no less than three 
percent of the total of all other proposed 
estimated expenditures of the Crown to cover:










(a) unforeseen but unavoidable 
expenditures; and









(b) revenues of the Crown being less than 
estimated.






Use of 
contingency 
reserve


(2) Any amount of a contingency reserve 
that is not expended in the fiscal year for 
which it is provided must be applied at the end 
of the fiscal year to reduce the debt of Canada.







Special deficit 
in unusual 
circumstances


6. If a special deficit is created by the 
expenditures of the Crown exceeding the 
revenues of the Crown in a fiscal year, and the 
Auditor General of Canada certifies that the 
deficit has been substantially caused by any of 
the following special circumstances:










(a) natural catastrophes resulting in a loss of 
revenue to the Crown or an increase in 
expenditure by the Crown;









(b) a war or apprehended war or an 
insurrection or apprehended insurrection; 
or









(c) a reduction in revenue of five percent or 
more in the fiscal year from the previous 
fiscal year that has not been caused by a 
change in law,









the special deficit is not a contravention of 
section 3, but budgets presented to Parliament 
during the following three fiscal years must 
provide for the special deficit so created to be 
paid off, even if the special circumstances 
continue.







Expenditure 
reduction


7. If the Minister of Finance has reason to 
believe, during a fiscal year that revenues of 
the Crown will be less for the year than 
estimated in the budget for the year, except in 
circumstances described in paragraph 6(a), 
(b) or (c), and that, notwithstanding the 
contingency reserve, the shortfall in revenues 
is likely to create a deficit for the year, the 
Minister shall reduce the expenditures that 
have been planned for the balance of the year 
sufficiently to avoid the creation of a deficit 
for the year.
