1st Session, 37th Parliament,
49-50 Elizabeth II, 2001 










House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-372









An Act to provide for the harmonization of 
environmental standards throughout 
Canada







Preamble


 Whereas the environment of Canada is 
indivisible and most pollutants are not fixed in 
one location but move, by means of our water 
and atmosphere and by human intervention 
throughout the nation;










 Whereas Canada and its provinces have 
similar objectives for the protection of the 
environment;










 Whereas environmental standards have 
been set at similar but not identical levels 
throughout the nation;










 Whereas environmental quality can best be 
maintained throughout Canada if standards, 
monitoring procedures and enforcement 
methods are consistent throughout the nation;










 And Whereas those who have to control 
emissions such as municipalities and industry 
will benefit from efficiency, certainty and 
standardization of equipment and procedures 
if environmental standards are uniform across 
the nation;










Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:










 






Short title


1. This Act may be cited as the National 
Environmental Standards Act.
