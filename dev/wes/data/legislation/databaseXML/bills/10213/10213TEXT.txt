Canadian Shield, based on the concept 
described by Atomic Energy of Canada

technical description of each proposed 
approach and must specify an economic 
region for its implementation.







Comparison 
of risks, etc.


(4) Each proposed approach must include a 
comparison of the benefits, risks and costs of 
that approach with those of the other 
approaches, taking into account the economic

implemented, as well as ethical, social and 
economic considerations associated with that 
approach.







Services to 
certain owners 
of waste

waste management organization as a result of 
those consultations.







Financial 
aspects


13. (1) The study must set out, with respect 
to each proposed approach, a formula to 
calculate the annual amount required to 
finance the management of nuclear fuel 
waste. The report must explain the 
assumptions behind each term of the formula. 
The formula must include the following 
terms:










(a) the estimated total cost of management 
of nuclear fuel waste, which must take into 
account natural or other events that have a 
reasonable probability of occurring;

explanation of how those respective 
percentages were determined.







Financial 
guarantees

management of nuclear fuel waste that have 
been provided by the nuclear energy 
corporations and Atomic Energy of Canada 
Limited under the Nuclear Safety and Control 
Act.







Minister may 
consult public


14. (1) The Minister may engage in such 
consultations with the general public on the 
approaches set out in the study as the Minister 
considers necessary.
