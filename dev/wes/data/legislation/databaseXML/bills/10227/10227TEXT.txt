BILL C-350









An Act to protect human health and the

specified amount of oxygen;

Conference on Environment and 
Development in 1992 to applying the 
precautionary principle;

precautionary principle, it is imperative for 
the Parliament of Canada to take immediate 
action to protect human health and the 
environment by banning these harmful or 
potentially harmful automotive fuels;










Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of
