adding the following after subsection (2):







Criteria for 
eligibility


(3) In order that a province may qualify for 
a full cash contribution referred to in section

home or elsewhere, to remain in school or to 
continue that instruction, as the case may be, 
until the person attains the age of eighteen 
years.







Exception


(4) The criteria in subsection (3) are not 
contravened by a law exempting a person 
from attending school or continuing 
instruction, as the case may be, until the 
person attains the age of eighteen years, on the 
basis that it is in the best interests of the person 
to be so exempted.

program approved by the government of a 
province.
