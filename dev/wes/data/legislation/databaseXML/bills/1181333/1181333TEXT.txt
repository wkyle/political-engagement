SUMMARY









The purpose of this enactment is to expand the list of allowable 
medical expense deductions in the Income Tax Act to include expenses 
incurred for a herbal remedy prescribed as a substitute for a prescription 
drug that would qualify as a medical expense under that Act, but which 
a person cannot use because he or she has severe allergies or 
environmental sensitivities to that drug.
