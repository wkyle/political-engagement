SUMMARY









This enactment provides that a member's seat in the House of 
Commons will be vacated, thus precipitating the calling of a 
by-election, if the member, having been elected to the House as a 
member of a political party or as an independent, changes parties in the 
House or becomes a member of a party in the House, as the case may 
be, at any time during the term for which he or she was elected. A 
member's seat will not be vacated, if the member, having been elected 
as a member of a political party, chooses to sit as an independent at any 
time during the term for which he or she was elected.
