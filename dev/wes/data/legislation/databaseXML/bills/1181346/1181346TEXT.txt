SUMMARY









This enactment amends certain provisions of the Criminal Code that 
relate to life imprisonment. The enactment provides that such a sentence 
means imprisonment without any access to parole for the remainder of 
the natural life of the offender.










The enactment also repeals sections 745.6 to 745.64, which allow an 
offender to apply, after 15 years, for a reduction in the period to be 
served before parole eligibility. This ensures that the full parole 
eligibility period ordered by the court is served.
