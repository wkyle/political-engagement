SUMMARY









This enactment makes it an offence for a woman who is pregnant to 
consume a substance harmful to a foetus that she does not have a fixed 
intention to abort.










This enactment also authorizes a court to make orders confining the 
mother to an appropriate treatment facility during the pregnancy and, 
upon release, to report to her physician weekly until the pregnancy 
ends.
