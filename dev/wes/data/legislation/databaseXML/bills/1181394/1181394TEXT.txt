SUMMARY









The purpose of Part 1 of this enactment is to establish the office of 
First Nations Ombudsman to assist persons dealing with a First Nation 
or one First Nation dealing with another or between First Nations and 
the Government of Canada, if they consider that they are being dealt 
with unfairly or unreasonably or with unreasonable delay. The 
Ombudsman may investigate complaints and report to the Minister on 
complaints that are not satisfactorily resolved.










The Ombudsman may propose changes to be made in a First 
Nation's administrative policies and practices. If a First Nation fails to 
change its policies and practices at the suggestion of the Ombudsman, 
the Ombudsman shall make a report to the Minister and the report must 
then be laid before Parliament.










Part 2 provides for an official from the office of the Auditor General 
of Canada to be appointed as First Nations Auditor to carry out audits 
of First Nations communities that are insolvent or where impropriety in 
financial management is alleged.










The Auditor may propose changes in a First Nations financial 
management practices and may make reports in the same manner as the 
Ombudsman.
