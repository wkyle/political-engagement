SUMMARY









At present the Criminal Code provides that a court must, in imposing 
a sentence, take into account the principle that imprisonment should, 
within reason, be seen as a last resort, especially for Aboriginal 
offenders. With this enactment the court is no longer mandated to give 
such special consideration to aboriginal offenders.
