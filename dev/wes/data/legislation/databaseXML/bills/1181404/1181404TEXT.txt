SUMMARY









The purpose of this enactment is to establish the office of Pension 
Ombudsman to assist persons dealing with the government on benefits 
under the Canada Pension Plan or the Old Age Security Act or tax 
liabilities thereon in case where they are dealt with unfairly or 
unreasonably or with unreasonable delay. The Ombudsman may 
investigate complaints and report on complaints that are not 
satisfactorily resolved. The reports may be to the relevant minister as to 
specific details of complaints, or in general terms to a Standing 
Committee of the House of Commons.










The Ombudsman may propose changes in the way the public is 
served in these matters with respect to fairness, reasonableness and 
promptness.










If a department fails to improve its policies and practices at the 
suggestion of the Ombudsman, the Ombudsman may make a report to 
the Minister, and the report must then be laid before Parliament.
