SUMMARY









This enactment provides that where the Minister intends to make a 
report to the Governor in Council that a person has obtained, retained, 
renounced or resumed citizenship by false representation or fraud or by 
knowingly concealing material circumstances, the Minister shall give 
notice to the person of that intention by personal service unless the 
Court agrees that it may be given by registered mail.










It also allows any decision of the Federal Court-Trial Division on 
the issue to be appealed to the Federal Court of Appeal and thence to the 
Supreme Court of Canada, with leave of the court in both cases, and 
allows a final application to the Governor in Council on compassionate 
grounds.










Provision is made for the appeals and applications to be available for 
past as well as future cases.
