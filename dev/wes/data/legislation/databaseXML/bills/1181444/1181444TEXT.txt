SUMMARY









The purpose of this enactment is to establish a process for 
co-operation between all stakeholders to establish standards for 
apprenticeship, institutional training and certification for prescribed 
trades and to secure the recognition of the standards across Canada. The 
standards will recognize the labour market and the need for a 
school-to-work transition.










The Minister is given the power to establish a national 
apprenticeship and training committee (NATAC) for each prescribed 
trade with representatives from provinces and labour, industry and 
instructional stakeholders. The NATAC will advise the Minister with 
respect to the trade it represents.










There will be an annual report to Parliament on the functions of the 
NATACs, which will be referred to a committee.
