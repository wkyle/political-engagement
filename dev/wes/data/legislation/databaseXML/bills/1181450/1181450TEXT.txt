SUMMARY









This enactment provides that federal work places must have 
available on site an automated external defibrillator and a sufficient 
number of employees trained in its use. This applies to locations that 
serve the public such as airports and railway stations, as well as 
locations to which only employees have access.










It allows regulations to prescribe training; to exempt small work 
places from the requirement to have a defibrillator and a trained 
employee available; to require large work places to have more 
defibrillators; and to remove the need for trained employees at times 
when very few employees or members of the public are normally 
present.










Those who use in a good faith a defibrillator made available at a work 
place under this enactment are protected against criminal or civil 
liability.
