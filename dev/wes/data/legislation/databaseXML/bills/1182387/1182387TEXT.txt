SUMMARY









The purpose of this enactment is to protect a child in the custody of 
one parent from being required to visit the other parent, while the other 
parent is serving a term of imprisonment for any offence under the 
Criminal Code of which the child was the victim, or for any of certain 
specified sexual offences under the Criminal Code, whoever was the 
victim.










Court access orders will be deemed to contain a provision that any 
right of access by the non-custodial spouse or former spouse is 
suspended while serving a term of imprisonment for such an offence, 
unless the custodial spouse or former spouse consents.
