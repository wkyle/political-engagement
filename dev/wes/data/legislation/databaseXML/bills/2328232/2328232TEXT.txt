employment


5. (1) Subject to subsection (2), insurable 
employment is










(a) employment in Canada by one or more 
employers, under any express or implied 
contract of service or apprenticeship, 
written or oral, whether the earnings of the 
employed person are received from the 
employer or some other person and whether 
the earnings are calculated by time or by the 
piece, or partly by time and partly by the 
piece, or otherwise;









(b) employment in Canada as described in 
paragraph (a) by Her Majesty in right of 
Canada;









(c) service in the Canadian Forces or in a 
police force;









(d) employment included by regulations 
made under subsection (4) or (5); and









(e) employment in Canada of an individual 
as the sponsor or co-ordinator of an 
employment benefits project.

employment


(2) Insurable employment does not include










(a) employment of a casual nature other 
than for the purpose of the employer's trade 
or business;









(b) the employment of a person by a 
corporation if the person controls more than 
40% of the voting shares of the corporation;

government of a country other than Canada 
or of any political subdivision of the other

Arm's length 
dealing

(a) the question of whether persons are not 
dealing with each other at arm's length shall 
be determined in accordance with the 
Income Tax Act; and









(b) if the employer is, within the meaning of 
that Act, related to the employee, they are 
deemed to deal with each other at arm's 
length if the Minister of National Revenue 
is satisfied that, having regard to all the 
circumstances of the employment, 
including the remuneration paid, the terms 
and conditions, the duration and the nature 
and importance of the work performed, it is 
reasonable to conclude that they would 
have entered into a substantially similar 
contract of employment if they had been 
dealing with each other at arm's length.






Regulations to 
include 
employment


(4) The Commission may, with the approval 
of the Governor in Council, make regulations

under a contract of service if it appears to

the work performed by, persons employed 
in that employment are similar to the terms 
and conditions of service of, and the nature 
of the work performed by, persons 
employed under a contract of service;









(d) employment in Canada by Her Majesty 
in right of a province if the government of 
the province waives exclusion and agrees to 
insure all its employees engaged in that 
employment;









(e) employment in Canada by the 
government of a country other than Canada 
or of any political subdivision of the other 
country if the employing government

Regulations to 
exclude 
employment


(6) The Commission may, with the approval 
of the Governor in Council, make regulations

country other than Canada a duplication of 
contributions or benefits will result;









(b) the entire employment of a person who 
is engaged by one employer partly in 
insurable employment and partly in other 
employment;

performed by persons employed in that 
employment is similar to the nature of the 
work performed by persons employed in 
employment that is not insurable 
employment;









(d) the employment of a member of a 
religious order who has taken a vow of
