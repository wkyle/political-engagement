the following area, being the Convention 
Area of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries 
Organization, that is on the high seas:










(a) the waters of the Northwest Atlantic 
Ocean north of 35o north latitude and 
west of a line extending due north 
from 35o north latitude and 42o west 
longitude to 59o north latitude, thence 
due west to 44o west longitude, and 
thence due north to the coast of 
Greenland, and









(b) the waters of the Gulf of St. 
Lawrence, Davis Strait and Baffin Bay 
south of 78o north latitude;






``straddling 
stock''
« stock 
chevauchant »


``straddling stock'' means a prescribed stock 
of fish.










2. The Act is amended by adding the 
following after section 5:







Purpose


5.1 Parliament, recognizing










(a) that straddling stocks on the Grand 
Banks of Newfoundland are a major 
renewable world food source having 
provided a livelihood for centuries to 
fishers,









(b) that those stocks are threatened with 
extinction,









(c) that there is an urgent need for all fishing 
vessels to comply in both Canadian 
fisheries waters and the NAFO Regulatory 
Area with sound conservation and 
management measures for those stocks, 
notably those measures that are taken under 
the Convention on Future Multilateral 
Cooperation in the Northwest Atlantic 
Fisheries, done at Ottawa on October 24, 
1978, Canada Treaty Series 1979 No. 11, 
and









(d) that some foreign fishing vessels 
continue to fish for those stocks in the 
NAFO Regulatory Area in a manner that 
undermines the effectiveness of sound 
conservation and management measures,









declares that the purpose of section 5.2 is to 
enable Canada to take urgent action necessary 
to prevent further destruction of those stocks 
and to permit their rebuilding, while 
continuing to seek effective international 
solutions to the situation referred to in 
paragraph (d).







Conservation 
and 
management 
measures for 
the NAFO 
Regulatory 
Area


5.2 No person, being aboard a foreign 
fishing vessel of a prescribed class, shall, in 
the NAFO Regulatory Area, fish or prepare to 
fish for a straddling stock in contravention of 
any of the prescribed conservation and 
management measures.










3. Section 6 of the Act is amended by 
adding the following after paragraph (b):










(b.1) prescribing as a straddling stock, for 
the purposes of section 5.2, any stock of fish 
that occurs both within Canadian fisheries 
waters and in an area beyond and adjacent 
to Canadian fisheries waters;









(b.2) prescribing any class of foreign 
fishing vessel for the purposes of section 
5.2;









(b.3) prescribing, for the purposes of 
section 5.2,









(i) any measure for the conservation and 
management of any straddling stock to be 
complied with by persons aboard a 
foreign fishing vessel of a prescribed 
class in order to ensure that the foreign 
fishing vessel does not engage in any 
activity that undermines the 
effectiveness of conservation and 
management measures for any straddling 
stock that are taken under the Convention 
on Future Multilateral Cooperation in 
the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries, done at 
Ottawa on October 24, 1978, Canada 
Treaty Series 1979 No. 11, or









(ii) any other measure for the 
conservation and management of any 
straddling stock to be complied with by 
persons aboard a foreign fishing vessel of 
a prescribed class;









(b.4) prescribing the manner in which and 
the extent to which a protection officer is 
permitted to use the force referred to in 
section 8.1;









(b.5) prescribing forms that may be used 
instead of the forms set out in Part XXVIII 
of the Criminal Code in proceedings against 
fishing vessels under this Act or the 
Fisheries Act;

that will afford evidence in respect of, a 
contravention of this Act or the regulations, 
may issue a warrant authorizing the protection 
officer named in the warrant to enter and 
search the place for the fish or other thing 
subject to any conditions that may be specified 
in the warrant.







Where 
warrant not 
necessary


(2) A protection officer may exercise the 
powers referred to in paragraph 7(b) without 
a warrant if the conditions for obtaining a 
warrant exist but, by reason of exigent 
circumstances, it would not be practical to 
obtain a warrant.










5. The Act is amended by adding the 
following after section 8:







Use of force


8.1 A protection officer may, in the manner 
and to the extent prescribed by the regulations, 
use force that is intended or is likely to disable
