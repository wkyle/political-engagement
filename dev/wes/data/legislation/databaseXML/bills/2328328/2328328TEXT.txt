Deductions for Research






Deductions 
for research


33.1 (1) For the purpose of providing 
additional funding for plant breeding research 
into new and improved wheat varieties, the 
Board shall, with the approval of the Governor 
in Council and at such rate as is fixed by the 
Governor in Council, make a deduction from 
the amount to be paid under subsection 33(2) 
to each holder of a certificate from the balance 
remaining in the Board's account in respect of 
wheat.







Special 
account


(2) The Board shall establish a special 
account for each pool period and all 
deductions under subsection (1) in respect of 
a pool period shall be credited to the special 
account for that pool period.







Payment to 
research 
funding 
agency


(3) Subject to subsection (4), not later than 
one hundred and eighty days after the end of 
each pool period, the Board shall pay the 
balance in the special account for that pool 
period to such agency, in this section and 
sections 33.2 to 33.4 referred to as the 
``research funding agency'', as is designated 
by the Governor in Council for the purpose of 
funding research activities.







Deduction 
and 
adjustment for 
costs


(4) Before making a payment under 
subsection (3), the Board shall










(a) take from the special account an amount 
equal to the costs the Board estimates it 
incurred and will incur in relation to the 
making and the administration of the 
deductions for the pool period in respect of 
which the account relates; and









(b) add to or remove from the account, as 
the case may be, the difference between the 
costs actually incurred by the Board in 
relation to the making and the 
administration of the deductions for the 
preceding pool period and the amount taken 
by it pursuant to paragraph (a) in respect of 
that preceding pool period.






Distribution 
by agency


(5) Subject to subsection (6) and 
section 33.2, the research funding agency 
shall distribute moneys received by it pursuant 
to subsection (3) to persons and plant 
breeding centres engaged in research 
activities into new and improved wheat 
varieties with whom it has entered into 
research contracts.







Deduction 
and 
adjustment for 
costs


(6) Before making a distribution under 
subsection (5), the research funding agency 
shall, subject to such agreement as the 
Minister may enter into with the research 
funding agency,










(a) take from the moneys received pursuant 
to subsection (3) an amount equal to the 
costs that it estimates it incurred and will 
incur in relation to the application of this 
Part in respect of the pool period to which 
the moneys relate; and









(b) add to or remove from those moneys, as 
the case may be, the difference between the 
costs actually incurred by the agency in 
relation to the application of this Part in 
respect of the preceding pool period and the 
amount taken by it pursuant to 
paragraph (a) in respect of that preceding 
pool period.






Reserve 
account


33.2 (1) The research funding agency shall 
establish a reserve account into which a 
portion, determined in accordance with such 
rate as may be fixed by the Governor in 
Council, of the moneys received by it pursuant 
to subsection 33.1(3) shall be deposited.







Use of reserve 
account


(2) The research funding agency may use 
the reserve account to fund existing research 
contracts referred to in subsection 33.1(5) 
where no deductions are made under 
subsection 33.1(1) in respect of any pool 
period or, where such deductions are made, 
the deductions are insufficient to cover those 
contracts.







Annual report


33.3 The research funding agency shall, as 
soon as possible after March 31 in each year 
and in any event not later than three months 
after that date, submit to the Minister an 
annual report, in such form as the Minister 
may prescribe, of its affairs and operations in 
relation to this Part during the twelve month 
period ending on December 31.







Deductions 
are voluntary


33.4 (1) The holder of a certificate may 
choose to be exempted from the application of 
section 33.1 for any particular pool period by 
filing with the Board, before such date as is 
fixed by the Governor in Council, a notice 
stating that no deduction should be made in 
respect of that holder.







Pool period 
commencing 
August 1, 
1993


(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), the 
Board shall make deductions under section 
33.1 in respect of the pool period commencing 
on August 1, 1993 as though no holder of a 
certificate had filed a notice referred to in 
subsection (1), but any holder of a certificate 
who files such a notice with the research 
funding agency before February 28, 1995 
shall, in accordance with the terms and 
conditions established by the Governor in 
Council, be paid by the research funding 
agency an amount equal to the amount 
deducted for that pool period in respect of that 
holder.







Exemptions


33.5 The Governor in Council may exempt 
holders of certificates from the deduction 
under section 33.1 on the basis of










(a) the class of wheat sold by them; or









(b) the province or region where the wheat 
was produced.
