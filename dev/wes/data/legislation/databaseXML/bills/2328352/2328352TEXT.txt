POWERS OF MINISTER






Regulations


4. (1) The Minister may make regulations










(a) designating as a violation that may be 
proceeded with in accordance with this Act









(i) the contravention of any specified 
provision of an agri-food Act or of a 
regulation made under an agri-food Act,









(ii) the contravention of any specified 
order, or class of orders, made by the 
Minister under the Plant Protection Act, 
or









(iii) the refusal or neglect to perform any 
specified duty, or class of duties, imposed 
by or under the Plant Protection Act or 
the Health of Animals Act,









if the contravention, or the failure or neglect 
to perform the duty, as the case may be, is 
an offence under an agri-food Act;









(b) classifying each violation as a minor 
violation, a serious violation or a very 
serious violation;









(c) fixing a penalty, or a range of penalties, 
in respect of each violation;









(d) respecting the circumstances under 
which, the criteria by which and the manner 
in which a penalty may be increased or 
reduced, including the reduction of a 
penalty pursuant to a compliance 
agreement under subsection 10(1);









(e) respecting the determination of a lesser 
amount that may be paid in complete 
satisfaction of a penalty if paid within the 
prescribed time and manner;









(f) respecting the circumstances under 
which reviews under this Act by the 
Tribunal shall be oral or in writing;









(g) respecting the service of documents 
required or authorized to be served under 
this Act including, without restricting the 
generality of the foregoing, the manner of 
serving such documents, the proof of their 
service and the circumstances under which 
such documents shall be deemed to have 
been served;









(h) prescribing anything that by this Act is 
to be prescribed; and









(i) generally, for carrying out the purposes 
and provisions of this Act.






Maximum 
penalties


(2) The maximum penalty for a violation is










(a) in the case of a violation that is 
committed by an individual otherwise than 
in the course of a business and that is not 
committed to obtain a financial benefit, 
$2,000; and









(b) in any other case, $2,000 for a minor 
violation, $10,000 for a serious violation 
and $15,000 for a very serious violation.






Criteria


(3) Without restricting the generality of 
paragraph (1)(d), in making regulations 
respecting the criteria for increasing or 
reducing the amount of the penalty for a 
violation, the Minister shall include the 
following in any such criteria:










(a) the degree of intention or negligence on 
the part of the person who committed the 
violation;









(b) the harm done by the violation; and









(c) the history of the person who committed 
the violation of prior violations or 
convictions under agri-food Acts within the 
five year period immediately before the 
violation.






How act or 
omission may 
be proceeded 
with


5. Where any act or omission can be 
proceeded with as a violation or as an offence, 
the Minister may commence proceedings in 
respect of that act or omission as a violation or 
recommend that it be proceeded with as an 
offence, but proceeding with it as a violation 
precludes proceeding with it as an offence, 
and proceeding with it as an offence precludes 
proceeding with it as a violation.







Duties of 
Minister re 
notices of 
violation


6. The Minister may










(a) designate persons, or classes of persons, 
who are authorized to issue notices of 
violation; and

of violation.

imposed by or under the Plant Protection 
Act or the Health of Animals Act









the contravention of which, or the refusal or 
neglect of which, is designated to be a 
violation by a regulation made under 
paragraph 4(1)(a) commits a violation and is 
liable to a warning or to a penalty in 
accordance with this Act.

paying and the manner of paying the

default

the forfeiture of the security given under the 
compliance agreement, that security is 
forfeited to Her Majesty in right of Canada 
and the proceedings commenced in respect 
of the violation under section 7 are ended.






Effect of 
payment

in a notice of default under subsection (4) in

and in complete satisfaction of the amount

of the violation under section 7 are ended.
