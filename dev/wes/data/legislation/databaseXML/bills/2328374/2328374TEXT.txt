CHAPTER 32









An Act to amend the Criminal Code 
(self-induced intoxication)










[Assented to 13th July, 1995] 


















Preamble


 WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada is 
gravely concerned about the incidence of 
violence in Canadian society;










 WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada 
recognizes that violence has a particularly 
disadvantaging impact on the equal 
participation of women and children in 
society and on the rights of women and 
children to security of the person and to the 
equal protection and benefit of the law as 
guaranteed by sections 7, 15 and 28 of the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms;










 WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada 
recognizes that there is a close association 
between violence and intoxication and is 
concerned that self-induced intoxication may 
be used socially and legally to excuse 
violence, particularly violence against women 
and children;










 WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada 
recognizes that the potential effects of alcohol 
and certain drugs on human behaviour are 
well known to Canadians and is aware of 
scientific evidence that most intoxicants, 
including alcohol, by themselves, will not 
cause a person to act involuntarily;










 WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada 
shares with Canadians the moral view that 
people who, while in a state of self-induced 
intoxication, violate the physical integrity of 
others are blameworthy in relation to their 
harmful conduct and should be held 
criminally accountable for it;










 WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada 
desires to promote and help to ensure the full 
protection of the rights guaranteed under 
sections 7, 11, 15 and 28 of the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms for all 
Canadians, including those who are or may be 
victims of violence;










 WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada 
considers it necessary to legislate a basis of 
criminal fault in relation to self-induced 
intoxication and general intent offences 
involving violence;










 WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada 
recognizes the continuing existence of a 
common law principle that intoxication to an 
extent that is less than that which would cause 
a person to lack the ability to form the basic 
intent or to have the voluntariness required to 
commit a criminal offence of general intent is 
never a defence at law;










 AND WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada 
considers it necessary and desirable to 
legislate a standard of care, in order to make 
it clear that a person who, while in a state of 
incapacity by reason of self-induced 
intoxication, commits an offence involving 
violence against another person, departs 
markedly from the standard of reasonable care 
that Canadians owe to each other and is 
thereby criminally at fault;

NOW, THEREFORE, Her Majesty, by and 
with the advice and consent of the Senate and 
House of Commons of Canada, enacts as 
follows:










 









1. The Criminal Code is amended by 
adding the following after section 33:










Self-induced Intoxication






When defence 
not available


33.1 (1) It is not a defence to an offence 
referred to in subsection (3) that the accused, 
by reason of self-induced intoxication, lacked 
the general intent or the voluntariness 
required to commit the offence, where the 
accused departed markedly from the standard 
of care as described in subsection (2).







Criminal fault 
by reason of 
intoxication


(2) For the purposes of this section, a person 
departs markedly from the standard of 
reasonable care generally recognized in 
Canadian society and is thereby criminally at 
fault where the person, while in a state of 
self-induced intoxication that renders the 
person unaware of, or incapable of 
consciously controlling, their behaviour, 
voluntarily or involuntarily interferes or 
threatens to interfere with the bodily integrity 
of another person.







Application


(3) This section applies in respect of an 
offence under this Act or any other Act of 
Parliament that includes as an element an 
assault or any other interference or threat of 
interference by a person with the bodily 
integrity of another person.







Coming into 
force


2. This Act shall come into force on a day 
to be fixed by order of the Governor in 
Council.
