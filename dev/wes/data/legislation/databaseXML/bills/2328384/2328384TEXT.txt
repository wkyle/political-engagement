(i) endeavour to mediate all the matters 
referred to it and to bring about an 
agreement between the employer and the

of all such matters.






Appropriate 
contractual 
language

appropriate collective agreement or, where 
necessary, draft a new agreement between the 
employer and the union that contains all 
agreements and decisions referred to in that 
paragraph.







Guiding 
principle


12. Each Commission shall be guided by 
the need for terms and conditions of

the long term, taking into account the 
importance of good labour-management 
relations.







Powers

engage the services of such technical advisers 
or other experts and assistants as the 
Commission considers necessary.







Decisions of 
Commission


14. The decision of a majority of the 
members of a Commission is the decision of 
the Commission, but if a majority of the 
members of the Commission cannot agree on 
a decision, the decision of the Chairperson of 
the Commission is the decision of the 
Commission.







Incorporation 
in collective 
agreement


15. (1) As of the day that a Commission 
reports to the Minister pursuant to paragraph 
11(1)(c), each collective agreement between 
the employer and a union shall be deemed to 
be amended by the incorporation therein of










(a) any agreement resolving the matters in 
dispute between the employer and the union 
arrived at before, or pursuant to, mediation 
by the Commission; and









(b) any decision of the Commission in 
respect of any matters arbitrated by it.






New 
collective 
agreement


(2) Each collective agreement amended by 
subsection (1), or each new agreement drafted 
by the Commission pursuant to subsection 
11(2), as the case may be, constitutes a new 
collective agreement that, subject to 
subsection (3), is effective and binding on the 
parties thereto for a period beginning on the 
day on which the report of the Commission is 
submitted to the Minister and ending on the 
day fixed by the Commission pursuant to 
paragraph 11(1)(b), notwithstanding anything 
in Part I of the Canada Labour Code, and that 
Part applies in respect of the new collective 
agreement as if it had been entered into 
pursuant to that Part.







Coming into 
effect of 
provisions


(3) A new collective agreement established 
by this Part may provide that any provision 
thereof is effective and binding on a day 
before or after the day on which the new
