Act.










INTERPRETATION






Definitions


2. (1) In this Act,







``regulation''
« règlement »


``regulation'' means a document that is made 
under an Act of Parliament and expresses 
rules of conduct that are unilaterally 
imposed, have binding legal effect and are 
of general application and it includes any 
document that is called a regulation in an 
Act of Parliament;







``regulatory 
authority''
« autorité 
réglementante
 »


``regulatory authority'' means, with respect to 
a regulation or other document, the 
authority authorized to make the document 
but, if the document is authorized to be 
made by the Governor in Council, it means 
the minister who recommends the 
document to the Governor in Council or any 
other person or body designated by the 
Governor in Council;







``regulatory 
process''
« processus 
réglementaire 
»


``regulatory process'' means the process set 
out in sections 6 to 12.







Interpretation 
of 
``regulation''


(2) For greater certainty, ``regulation'' does 
not include an order of a court, but it includes 
a document that is made under an Act of 
Parliament and










(a) contains rules governing the practice or 
procedure in proceedings before a court or 
before a tribunal or agency designated 
under paragraph 26(a);









(b) fixes the day or time when an Act of 
Parliament or any of its provisions comes 
into force or ceases to have effect; or









(c) amends or repeals an Act of Parliament 
or a regulation.






General or 
specific 
exercise of 
powers


3. A power exercisable under this Act with 
respect to a regulation or other document may 
be exercised with respect to a particular 
document or with respect to a class of 
documents.










APPLICATION OF REGULATORY PROCESS






Application of 
the regulatory 
process


4. (1) The regulatory process applies to any 
regulation made under an enabling provision 
that calls it a regulation or specifies another 
type of document to be used to exercise the 
power conferred by the enabling provision, 
such as an order, by-law, list or guideline.







Exemption for 
certain types 
of forms


(2) The regulatory process does not apply to 
a form of an administrative nature that does 
not create substantive legal requirements, but 
merely gives effect to existing legal 
requirements.







Exemption 
power of 
Governor in 
Council


5. (1) The Governor in Council may, by 
regulation, exempt regulations from the 
application of the regulatory process.







Application 
power of the 
Governor in 
Council


(2) The Governor in Council may, by 
regulation, extend the application of the 
regulatory process, or any part of it, to a 
regulation that it does not already apply to, 
other than a regulation exempted from its 
application by any Act of Parliament.







Application 
power of 
Clerk of the 
Privy Council


(3) The Clerk of the Privy Council may 
extend the application of the regulatory 
process, or any part of it, to a document other 
than a regulation.







Principles of 
legality, 
accessibility 
and 
government 
accountability


(4) The powers of the Governor in Council 
and the Clerk of the Privy Council under this 
section are to be exercised in a way that 
respects the public interest in principles of 
legality, accessibility and government 
accountability in making regulations and 
other documents, taking into consideration the 
importance of










(a) achieving regulatory goals, including 
goals relating to safety, health, the 
environment and sustainable development, 
being development that meets the needs of 
the present without compromising the 
ability of future generations to meet their 
own needs; and









(b) reducing regulatory costs and delays.

of the regulatory authority.







Repeal of
