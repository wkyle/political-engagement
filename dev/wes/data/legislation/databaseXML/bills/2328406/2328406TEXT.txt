shall contain










(a) provisions imposing constraints on the

joint ownership, of voting shares of CN to 
prevent any one person, together with the 
associates of that person, from holding, 
beneficially owning or controlling, directly

shares to which are attached more than 
fifteen per cent of the votes that may 
ordinarily be cast to elect directors of CN;









(b) provisions respecting the enforcement 
of the constraints imposed pursuant to 
paragraph (a); and

declarations, the suspension of voting rights, 
the forfeiture of dividends, the refusal to issue 
or register voting shares and the sale of voting 
shares held contrary to the constraints and 
payment of the net proceeds of the sale to the 
person entitled to them.







Exceptions


(3) No provision imposing constraints 
pursuant to paragraph (1)(a) applies in respect 
of voting shares of CN that are held










(a) by the Minister in trust for Her Majesty 
in right of Canada;









(b) by one or more underwriters solely for 
the purpose of distributing the shares to the 
public; or









(c) by any person that is acting in relation to 
the shares solely in its capacity as an 
intermediary in the payment of funds or the 
delivery of securities, or both, in connection 
with trades in securities and that provides 
centralized facilities for the clearing of 
trades in securities.






Associates


(4) For the purposes of this section, a person 
is an associate of another person if










(a) one is a corporation of which the other 
is an officer or director;









(b) one is a corporation that is controlled by 
the other or by a group of persons of which 
the other is a member;









(c) one is a partnership of which the other is 
a partner;









(d) one is a trust of which the other is a 
trustee;









(e) both are corporations controlled by the 
same person;









(f) both are members of a voting trust that 
relates to voting shares of CN;









(g) both, in the reasonable opinion of the 
directors of CN, are parties to an agreement 
or arrangement a purpose of which is to 
require them to act in concert with respect 
to their interests, direct or indirect, in CN or 
are otherwise acting in concert with respect 
to those interests; or









(h) both are at the same time associates, 
within the meaning of any of paragraphs (a) 
to (g), of the same person.






Exceptions


(5) Notwithstanding subsection (4), for the 
purposes of this section,










(a) where a person who, but for this 
paragraph, would be an associate of another 
person submits to CN a statutory 
declaration stating that









(i) no voting shares of CN held or to be 
held by the declarant are or will be, to the 
declarant's knowledge, held in the right 
of, for the use or benefit of or under the 
control of, any other person of which, but 
for this paragraph, the declarant would be 
an associate, and









(ii) the declarant is not acting and will not 
act in concert with any such other person 
with respect to their interests, direct or 
indirect, in CN,









the declarant and that other person are not 
associates so long as the directors of CN are 
satisfied that the statements in the 
declaration are being complied with and 
that there are no other reasonable grounds 
for disregarding the declaration;









(b) two corporations are not associates 
pursuant to paragraph (4)(h) by reason only 
that under paragraph (4)(a) each is an 
associate of the same individual; and









(c) where it appears from the central 
securities register of CN that any person 
holds, beneficially owns or controls voting 
shares to which are attached not more than 
the lesser of two one-hundredths of one per 
cent of the votes that may ordinarily be cast 
to elect directors of CN and five thousand 
such votes, that person is not an associate of 
anyone else and no one else is an associate 
of that person.






Control


(6) For the purposes of this section, 
``control'' means control in any manner that 
results in control in fact, whether directly 
through the ownership of securities or 
indirectly through a trust, an agreement or 
arrangement, the ownership of any body 
corporate or otherwise, and, without limiting 
the generality of the foregoing,










(a) a body corporate is controlled by a 
person if









(i) securities of the body corporate to 
which are attached more than fifty per 
cent of the votes that may be cast to elect 
directors of the body corporate are held, 
otherwise than by way of security only, 
by or for the benefit of that person, and









(ii) the votes attached to those securities 
are sufficient, if exercised, to elect a 
majority of the directors of the body 
corporate; and









(b) a partnership or unincorporated 
organization is controlled by a person if an 
ownership interest therein representing 
more than fifty per cent of the assets of the 
partnership or organization is held, 
otherwise than by way of security only, by 
or for the benefit of that person.
