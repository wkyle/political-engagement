An Act to amend the Criminal Code (human 
being)







Preamble


 Whereas the Supreme Court of Canada has 
rendered judgment on the subject of abortion 
in the case of Morgentaler, Smoling and Scott 
v. Her Majesty the Queen and the Attorney 
General of Canada and in the case of 
Borowski v. Attorney General of Canada;










 And Whereas section 7 of the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms provides that 
everyone has the right to life;










 And Whereas the right to life is the most 
fundamental of all human rights;










 And Whereas the right to life of a person 
exists from the time of the conception to the 
time of the natural death of that person;










 Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with 
the advice and consent of the Senate and

whether in the womb of the mother or not 
and whether conceived naturally or other
wise;
