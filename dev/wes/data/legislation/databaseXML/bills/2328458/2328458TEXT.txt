1nd Session, 35th Parliament,
42-43 Elizabeth II, 1994










The House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-290









An Act providing for equal treatment for 
persons cohabiting in a relationship 
similar to a conjugal relationship

















Preamble


 Whereas the Constitution of Canada 
provides that every individual is equal before 
and under the law and has the right to the equal 
protection and benefit of the law without 
discrimination;










 And whereas the Government of Canada 
already recognizes the diversity of Canadians 
as regards race, national or ethnic origin, 
colour and religion as a fundamental 
characteristic of Canadian society;










 And whereas the Government of Canada is 
working to achieve the equality of all 
Canadians in the economic, social, cultural 
and political life of Canada;










 And whereas the Government of Canada 
recognizes the importance of the 
contributions of homosexuals and lesbians to 
the cultural, social, economic and political 
enrichment of Canada;










 And whereas homosexuals and lesbians in 
Canada constitute a minority that is frequently 
exposed to discrimination;










 And whereas the discrimination 
experienced by the homosexual minority in 
Canada is in many respects similar to that 
experienced by other minorities in Canada, 
particularly by visible and ethnic minorities;










 And whereas in recent years some Acts of 
Parliament have granted the same benefits as 
those granted to married persons to 
heterosexual couples cohabiting in 
relationships similar to conjugal 
relationships;










*ep










 And whereas the lives of homosexual and 
lesbian couples in Canada who cohabit in 
relationships similar to conjugal relationships 
are in many respects identical to the lives of 
heterosexual couples;










 And whereas homosexual and lesbian 
couples cohabiting in relationships similar to 
conjugal relationships do not at present 
receive the same benefits as those accorded 
heterosexual couples cohabiting in 
relationships similar to conjugal 
relationships;










 And whereas the Government of Canada 
wishes to end discrimination in Acts of 
Parliament against homosexual and lesbian 
couples by granting the individuals in such 
couples the same benefits that are received by 
heterosexual couples cohabiting in 
relationships similar to conjugal 
relationships;










 Now therefore, Her Majesty, by and with 
the advice and consent of the Senate and 
House of Commons of Canada, enacts as 
follows:
