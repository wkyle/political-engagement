CRIMINAL CODE

in section 462.3 of the Criminal Code is 
amended by striking out the word ``or'' at 
the end of paragraph (a), by adding the 
word ``or'' at the end of paragraph (b) and 
by adding the following after 
paragraph (b):










(c) the creation within or outside Canada of 
a work that recounts or depicts the 
commission of an actual offence of which a 
person has been convicted or that is based 
substantially on the commission of such an 
offence or the circumstances surrounding it, 
if









(i) the offence is one that may be 
proceeded against by indictment, and









(ii) the person convicted of the offence or 
a member of his family or a person 
dependent on him receives or becomes 
entitled to receive the property, benefit or 
advantage as a result of the authorship of 
or any collaboration or cooperation in the 
creation or publication of the work.  









2. The Act is amended by adding the 
following after section 729:







Copyright in 
works based 
on offence


729.1 Where a person is convicted of an 
offence that may be proceeded against by 
indictment, there is deemed to be included in 
and be a part of the sentence an order of the 
court that the convicted person and any work 
related to the offence is subject to section 12.1 
of the Copyright Act.

COPYRIGHT ACT









3. The Copyright Act is amended by 
adding the following after section 12:







Works by 
convicted 
persons 
relating to the 
crime


12.1 (1) Where a work is created, prepared 
or published by or in collaboration with a 
person who has been convicted of an offence 
under the Criminal Code that may be 
proceeded against by way of indictment, and 
the work is principally based on the indictable 
offence or the circumstances of its 
commission, any copyright in the work that 
would otherwise vest in the convicted person 
shall belong to Her Majesty and shall subsist 
for the time that the copyright would subsist if 
it belonged to the convicted person.







Application 
from date of 
charge


(2) Subsection (1) applies to any work 
published at any time following the time that 
the convicted person is charged with the 
indictable offence or with any other offence on 
the basis of the same circumstances.







No reversion 
to convicted 
person


(3) For greater certainty, copyright in a 
work that would otherwise vest in a convicted 
person but vests in the Crown by the 
application of subsection (1) does not revert to 
the convicted person on the completion of any 
sentence imposed with respect to the offence 
but continues to vest in the Crown.
