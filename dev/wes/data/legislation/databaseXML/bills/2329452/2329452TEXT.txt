power conferred by the enabling provision, 
such as an order, rule, by-law, list or guideline.







Exemption for 
certain types 
of forms


(2) The regulatory process does not apply to 
a form of an administrative nature that does 
not create substantive legal requirements, but 
merely gives effect to existing legal require
ments.

Governor in 
Council


5. (1) The Governor in Council may, by 
regulation, exempt regulations from the ap
plication of the regulatory process.

application by any Act of Parliament.







Application 
power of 
Clerk of the 
Privy Council


(3) The Clerk of the Privy Council may 
extend the application of the regulatory pro
cess, or any part of it, to a document other than

(4) The powers of the Governor in Council 
and the Clerk of the Privy Council under this

countability in making regulations and other 
documents, taking into consideration the 
importance of










(a) achieving regulatory goals, including 
goals relating to safety, health, the environ
