The House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-27









An Act to amend the Criminal Code (child 
prostitution, child sex tourism, criminal 
harassment and female genital 
mutilation)







Preamble


 WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada has 
grave concerns regarding violence against 
women and children and, in particular, child 
prostitution, criminal harassment and female 
genital mutilation;










 WHEREAS children, by virtue of their lack 
of maturity, are more vulnerable than adults to 
danger, exploitation and abuse and are in 
greater need of protection;










 WHEREAS the 9th United Nations 
Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the 
Treatment of Offenders (Cairo, 1995) urged 
Member States to adopt measures to prevent, 
prohibit, eliminate and impose effective 
sanctions against practices harmful to women 
and children;










 WHEREAS the United Nations 
Declaration on the Elimination of Violence 
against Women (General Assembly resolution 
48/104, 20 December 1993) and the Platform 
for Action of the Fourth World Conference on 
Women (Beijing, 1995) recognize that 
violence against women both violates, and 
impairs or nullifies, the enjoyment by women 
of their human rights and fundamental 
freedoms;










 WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada has 
grave concerns regarding the prostitution of 
children, whether in or outside Canada;










 WHEREAS, by ratifying the United 
Nations Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, Canada has undertaken to protect 
children from all forms of sexual exploitation 
and sexual abuse, and to take measures to 
prevent the exploitative use of children in 
prostitution or other unlawful sexual 
practices;










 WHEREAS a strong statement denouncing 
the exploitation of children involved in 
prostitution, in particular by their procurers, 
should be sent to the general public and, in 
particular, to persons involved in the 
administration of justice;










 WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada 
wishes to strongly denounce criminal 
harassment in Canadian society by 
strengthening the criminal law in this area, 
thereby providing further protection to the 
life, liberty and security of women and other 
victims of criminal harassment;










 WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada has 
grave concerns regarding the practice of 
female genital mutilation and in particular 
where that practice involves children;










 AND WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada 
believes that a clear statement that the 
criminal law of Canada applies to the practice 
of female genital mutilation will facilitate 
ongoing educational efforts in this area;
