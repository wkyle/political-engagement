Purpose


4. The purpose of this Part is to improve 
marketing opportunities for crops of eligible 
producers by guaranteeing the repayment of 
the advances made to them as a means of 
improving cash-flow at or after harvest.







Agreements to 
guarantee 
repayment of 
advances


5. (1) Subject to the other provisions of this 
Act, the Minister may make an agreement 
with an administrator for the purpose of 
guaranteeing the repayment of advances that 
the administrator makes to eligible producers 
from money borrowed for the purpose of 
making the advances, together with any 
interest on the advances.







Administra-
tor 
qualifications


(2) The administrator must demonstrate to 
the Minister that










(a) it represents eligible producers in an 
area who produce in that area a significant 
portion of the crop for which the advances 
will be made; and









(b) the administrator is capable of meeting 
its obligations under the advance guarantee 
agreement.






Terms and 
conditions


(3) In addition to designating the crop and 
specifying any other terms and conditions 
governing advances and their repayment, the 
advance guarantee agreement must provide 
that the administrator agrees










(a) to make an agreement with each buyer 
mentioned in subparagraph 10(2)(a)(i), 
other than the administrator, to withhold 
amounts as provided in that subparagraph 
and to remit them immediately to the 
administrator;









(b) to withhold amounts as provided in 
subparagraph 10(2)(a)(i) in cases where the 
administrator is the buyer;









(c) to make the advances from money 
borrowed from a lender;









(d) to ensure that the interest rate on the 
money borrowed by the administrator will 
not exceed the rate specified in the advance 
guarantee agreement;









(e) to take steps, in accordance with the 
terms and conditions of the advance 
guarantee agreement, to ensure that before 
an advance is made the crop is harvested, of 
marketable quality and adequately stored 
by the producer so as to remain of 
marketable quality until disposed of in 
accordance with the repayment agreement;









(f) to repay the money it borrows from the 
lender, together with the interest, by paying 
to the lender, within the period specified in 
the advance guarantee agreement, the 
amounts the administrator receives as 
repayment of advances;









(g) if a producer defaults, to pay









(i) to the lender, within the period 
specified in the advance guarantee 
agreement, the administrator's 
percentage, as determined under the 
regulations, of the amount of the 
producer's liability under paragraph 
22(a), and









(ii) to the Minister within the same period 
the same percentage of the amount of 
interest paid by the Minister under 
subsection 9(1);









(h) to pay to the Minister any additional 
interest resulting from its failure to make 
payments required by paragraphs (f) and 
(g); and









(i) to pay to the Minister, within the period 
specified in the advance guarantee 
agreement, the Minister's percentage, as 
determined under the regulations, of an 
amount repaid to the administrator under a 
repayment agreement by a defaulting 
producer if the Minister has previously 
made a payment for the producer under 
subsection 23(1).






Administra-
tion fees


(4) The administrator may charge fees to 
producers for administrative services, 
including fees for receiving and dealing with 
applications for advances and for 
administering advances. The fees may be 
charged only for the purpose of recovering 
administrative costs under this Part and are 
subject to any terms and conditions of the 
advance guarantee agreement.







Maximum 
contingent 
liability


(5) The aggregate contingent liability of 
Her Majesty in relation to principal 
outstanding under guarantees made under 
advance guarantee agreements must not at any 
time exceed $1.9 billion, or any greater 
amount that the Governor in Council may 
prescribe by regulation.







Obligations of 
administra-
tors


6. A guarantee is not effective unless the 
administrator complies with this Act and the 
advance guarantee agreement.







Emergency 
advance


7. (1) Despite paragraph 5(3)(e), the 
advance guarantee agreement may authorize 
the administrator to pay a portion of an 
advance as an emergency advance to an 
eligible producer if the producer has difficulty 
harvesting a crop because of unusual weather 
conditions and it is reasonable to expect the 
crop to be harvested in a marketable 
condition. Payment of the emergency advance 
is subject to any terms and conditions set out 
in the advance guarantee agreement.







Maximum 
amount


(2) The maximum amount of the 
emergency advance is the lesser of $25,000 
and 50% of the advance that the administrator 
expects to make to the producer on the basis of 
the amount of the crop that will be harvested.







Lender 
guarantee


8. A guarantee under the advance guarantee 
agreement may, with the approval of the 
Minister of Finance, be made to the lender 
instead of to the administrator if the Minister 
is satisfied that doing so will reduce the 
interest payable to the lender.







Payment of 
interest


9. (1) The Minister must, in relation to each 
producer, pay to the lender specified in the 
advance guarantee agreement the interest 
accruing during a crop year on the amounts 
borrowed by the administrator to pay the first 
$50,000 of the total of the following amounts 
advanced during the crop year, or any shorter 
period specified in the advance guarantee 
agreement:










(a) amounts advanced to the producer for all 
their crops; and









(b) the percentage of the amounts advanced 
to all related producers for all their crops 
that is attributable to the producer under 
subsection (2).






Attribution

producers are attributable to the producer as

the attributable percentage is 100%;
