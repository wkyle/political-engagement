45-46 Elizabeth II, 1996-97










The House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-46









An Act to amend the Criminal Code 
(production of records in sexual offence 
proceedings)







Preamble


 WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada 
continues to be gravely concerned about the 
incidence of sexual violence and abuse in 
Canadian society and, in particular, the 
prevalence of sexual violence against women 
and children;










 WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada 
recognizes that violence has a particularly 
disadvantageous impact on the equal 
participation of women and children in 
society and on the rights of women and 
children to security of the person, privacy and 
equal benefit of the law as guaranteed by 
sections 7, 8, 15 and 28 of the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms;










 WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada 
intends to promote and help to ensure the full 
protection of the rights guaranteed by the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms for 
all, including those who are accused of, and 
those who are or may be victims of, sexual 
violence or abuse;










 WHEREAS the rights guaranteed by the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms are 
guaranteed equally to all and, in the event of 
a conflict, those rights are to be 
accommodated and reconciled to the greatest 
extent possible;










 WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada 
wishes to encourage the reporting of incidents 
of sexual violence and abuse and to provide 
for the prosecution of offences within a 
framework of laws that are consistent with the 
principles of fundamental justice and that are 
fair to complainants as well as to accused 
persons;










 WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada 
recognizes that the compelled production of 
personal information may deter complainants 
of sexual offences from reporting the offence 
to the police and may deter complainants from 
seeking necessary treatment, counselling or 
advice;










 WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada 
recognizes that the work of those who provide 
services and assistance to complainants of 
sexual offences is detrimentally affected by 
the compelled production of records and by 
the process to compel that production;










 AND WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada 
recognizes that, while production to the court 
and to the accused of personal information 
regarding any person may be necessary in 
order for an accused to make a full answer and 
defence, that production may breach the 
person's right to privacy and equality and 
therefore the determination as to whether to 
order production should be subject to careful 
scrutiny;

NOW, THEREFORE, Her Majesty, by and 
with the advice and consent of the Senate and 
House of Commons of Canada, enacts as 
follows:










 









1. The Criminal Code is amended by 
adding the following after section 278:







Definition of 
``record''


278.1 For the purposes of sections 278.2 to 
278.9, ``record'' means any form of record 
that contains personal information for which 
there is a reasonable expectation of privacy 
and includes, without limiting the generality 
of the foregoing, medical, psychiatric, 
therapeutic, counselling, education, 
employment, child welfare, adoption and 
social services records, personal journals and 
diaries, and records containing personal 
information the production or disclosure of 
which is protected by any other Act of 
Parliament or a provincial legislature, but 
does not include records made by persons 
responsible for the investigation or 
prosecution of the offence.







Production of 
record to 
accused


278.2 (1) No record relating to a 
complainant or a witness shall be produced to 
an accused in any proceedings in respect of










(a) an offence under section 151, 152, 153, 
155, 159, 160, 170, 171, 172, 173, 210, 211, 
212, 213, 271, 272 or 273,









(b) an offence under section 144, 145, 149, 
156, 245 or 246 of the Criminal Code, 
chapter C-34 of the Revised Statutes of 
Canada, 1970, as it read immediately 
before January 4, 1983, or









(c) an offence under section 146, 151, 153, 
155, 157, 166 or 167 of the Criminal Code, 
chapter C-34 of the Revised Statutes of 
Canada, 1970, as it read immediately 
before January 1, 1988,









or in any proceedings in respect of two or more 
offences that include an offence referred to in 
any of paragraphs (a) to (c), except in 
accordance with sections 278.3 to 278.91.







Application of 
provisions


(2) Section 278.1, this section and sections 
278.3 to 278.91 apply where a record is in the 
possession or control of any person, including 
the prosecutor in the proceedings, unless, in 
the case of a record in the possession or control 
of the prosecutor, the complainant or witness 
to whom the record relates has expressly 
waived the application of those sections.







Duty of 
prosecutor to 
give notice


(3) In the case of a record in respect of 
which this section applies that is in the 
possession or control of the prosecutor, the 
prosecutor shall notify the accused that the 
record is in the prosecutor's possession but, in 
doing so, the prosecutor shall not disclose the 
record's contents.







Application 
for production


278.3 (1) An accused who seeks production 
of a record referred to in subsection 278.2(1) 
must make an application to the judge before 
whom the accused is to be, or is being, tried.







No 
application in 
other 
proceedings


(2) For greater certainty, an application 
under subsection (1) may not be made to a 
judge or justice presiding at any other 
proceedings, including a preliminary inquiry.







Form and 
content of 
application


(3) An application must be made in writing 
and set out










(a) particulars identifying the record that 
the accused seeks to have produced and the 
name of the person who has possession or 
control of the record; and









(b) the grounds on which the accused relies 
to establish that the record is likely relevant 
to an issue at trial or to the competence of 
a witness to testify.






Insufficient 
grounds


(4) Any one or more of the following 
assertions by the accused are not sufficient on 
their own to establish that the record is likely 
relevant to an issue at trial or to the 
competence of a witness to testify:










(a) that the record exists;









(b) that the record relates to medical or 
psychiatric treatment, therapy or counsel
ling that the complainant or witness has 
received or is receiving;









(c) that the record relates to the incident that 
is the subject-matter of the proceedings;









(d) that the record may disclose a prior 
inconsistent statement of the complainant 
or witness;









(e) that the record may relate to the 
credibility of the complainant or witness;









(f) that the record may relate to the reliabil
ity of the testimony of the complainant or 
witness merely because the complainant or 
witness has received or is receiving psy
chiatric treatment, therapy or counselling;









(g) that the record may reveal allegations of 
sexual abuse of the complainant by a person 
other than the accused;









(h) that the record relates to the sexual 
activity of the complainant with any person, 
including the accused;









(i) that the record relates to the presence or 
absence of a recent complaint;









(j) that the record relates to the complain
ant's sexual reputation; or









(k) that the record was made close in time to 
a complaint or to the activity that forms the 
subject-matter of the charge against the 
accused.






Service of 
application 
and subpoena


(5) The accused shall serve the application 
on the prosecutor, on the person who has 
possession or control of the record, on the 
complainant or witness, as the case may be, 
and on any other person to whom, to the 
knowledge of the accused, the record relates, 
at least seven days before the hearing referred 
to in subsection 278.4(1) or any shorter 
interval that the judge may allow in the 
interests of justice. The accused shall also 
serve a subpoena issued under Part XXII in 
Form 16.1 on the person who has possession 
or control of the record at the same time as the 
application is served.







Service on 
other persons


(6) The judge may at any time order that the 
application be served on any person to whom 
the judge considers the record may relate.







Hearing in 
camera


278.4 (1) The judge shall hold a hearing in 
camera to determine whether to order the 
person who has possession or control of the 
record to produce it to the court for review by 
the judge.







Persons who 
may appear at 
hearing


(2) The person who has possession or 
control of the record, the complainant or 
witness, as the case may be, and any other 
person to whom the record relates may appear 
and make submissions at the hearing, but they 
are not compellable as witnesses at the 
hearing.







Costs


(3) No order for costs may be made against 
a person referred to in subsection (2) in respect 
of their participation in the hearing.







Judge may 
order 
production of 
record for 
review


278.5 (1) The judge may order the person 
who has possession or control of the record to 
produce the record or part of the record to the 
court for review by the judge if, after the 
hearing referred to in subsection 278.4(1), the 
judge is satisfied that










(a) the application was made in accordance 
with subsections 278.3(2) to (6);









(b) the accused has established that the 
record is likely relevant to an issue at trial 
or to the competence of a witness to testify; 
and









(c) the production of the record is necessary 
in the interests of justice.






Factors to be 
considered


(2) In determining whether to order the 
production of the record or part of the record 
for review pursuant to subsection (1), the 
judge shall consider the salutary and 
deleterious effects of the determination on the 
accused's right to make a full answer and 
defence and on the right to privacy and 
equality of the complainant or witness, as the 
case may be, and any other person to whom the 
record relates. In particular, the judge shall 
take the following factors into account:










(a) the extent to which the record is 
necessary for the accused to make a full 
answer and defence;









(b) the probative value of the record;









(c) the nature and extent of the reasonable 
expectation of privacy with respect to the 
record;









(d) whether production of the record is 
based on a discriminatory belief or bias;









(e) the potential prejudice to the personal 
dignity and right to privacy of any person to 
whom the record relates;









(f) society's interest in encouraging the 
reporting of sexual offences;









(g) society's interest in encouraging the 
obtaining of treatment by complainants of 
sexual offences; and









(h) the effect of the determination on the 
integrity of the trial process.






Review of 
record by 
judge


278.6 (1) Where the judge has ordered the 
production of the record or part of the record 
for review, the judge shall review it in the 
absence of the parties in order to determine 
whether the record or part of the record should 
be produced to the accused.







Hearing in 
camera


(2) The judge may hold a hearing in camera 
if the judge considers that it will assist in 
making the determination.







Provisions re 
hearing


(3) Subsections 278.4(2) and (3) apply in 
the case of a hearing under subsection (2).







Judge may 
order 
production of 
record to 
accused


278.7 (1) Where the judge is satisfied that 
the record or part of the record is likely 
relevant to an issue at trial or to the 
competence of a witness to testify and its 
production is necessary in the interests of 
justice, the judge may order that the record or 
part of the record that is likely relevant be 
produced to the accused, subject to any 
conditions that may be imposed pursuant to 
subsection (3).







Factors to be 
considered


(2) In determining whether to order the 
production of the record or part of the record 
to the accused, the judge shall consider the 
salutary and deleterious effects of the 
determination on the accused's right to make 
a full answer and defence and on the right to 
privacy and equality of the complainant or 
witness, as the case may be, and any other 
person to whom the record relates and, in 
particular, shall take the factors specified in 
paragraphs 278.5(2)(a) to (h) into account.







Conditions on 
production


(3) Where the judge orders the production 
of the record or part of the record to the 
accused, the judge may impose conditions on 
the production to protect the interests of 
justice and, to the greatest extent possible, the 
privacy and equality interests of the 
complainant or witness, as the case may be, 
and any other person to whom the record 
relates, including, for example, the following 
conditions:










(a) that the record be edited as directed by 
the judge;









(b) that a copy of the record, rather than the 
original, be produced;









(c) that the accused and counsel for the 
accused not disclose the contents of the 
record to any other person, except with the 
approval of the court;









(d) that the record be viewed only at the 
offices of the court;









(e) that no copies of the record be made or 
that restrictions be imposed on the number 
of copies of the record that may be made; 
and









(f) that information regarding any person 
named in the record, such as their address, 
telephone number and place of employ
ment, be severed from the record.






Copy to 
prosecutor


(4) Where the judge orders the production 
of the record or part of the record to the 
accused, the judge shall direct that a copy of 
the record or part of the record be provided to 
the prosecutor, unless the judge determines 
that it is not in the interests of justice to do so.







Record not to 
be used in 
other 
proceedings


(5) The record or part of the record that is 
produced to the accused pursuant to an order 
under subsection (1) shall not be used in any 
other proceedings.







Retention of 
record by 
court


(6) Where the judge refuses to order the 
production of the record or part of the record 
to the accused, the record or part of the record 
shall, unless a court orders otherwise, be kept 
in a sealed package by the court until the later 
of the expiration of the time for any appeal and 
the completion of any appeal in the 
proceedings against the accused, whereupon 
the record or part of the record shall be 
returned to the person lawfully entitled to 
possession or control of it.

decision

Publication 
prohibited

newspaper, as defined in section 297, or in a 
broadcast, any of the following:

or submissions made at a hearing under 
subsection 278.4(1) or 278.6(2); or









(c) the determination of the judge pursuant 
to subsection 278.5(1) or 278.7(1) and the 
reasons provided pursuant to section 278.8, 
unless the judge, after taking into account 
the interests of justice and the right to 
privacy of the person to whom the record 
relates, orders that the determination may 
be published.






Offence


(2) Every person who contravenes 
subsection (1) is guilty of an offence 
punishable on summary conviction.







Appeal


278.91 For the purposes of sections 675 and

make an order pursuant to subsection 278.5(1) 
or 278.7(1) is deemed to be a question of law.
