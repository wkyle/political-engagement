Purpose and Principles






Purpose of 
temporary 
absence


7. The purpose of a temporary absence 
program is to contribute to the maintenance of 
a just, peaceful and safe society by facilitat
ing, through decisions on the timing and 
conditions of absence, the rehabilitation of 
prisoners and their reintegration into the 
community as law-abiding citizens.







Principles


7.1 The principles that shall guide desig
nated authorities in achieving the purpose of 
a temporary absence program are










(a) that the least restrictive decision that is 
consistent with the protection of society and 
the prisoner's rehabilitation and reintegra
tion into the community be made;









(b) that all available information that is 
relevant to the case be taken into account;









(c) that prisoners be provided with relevant 
information, reasons for decisions and ac
cess to the review of decisions in order to 
ensure a fair and understandable temporary 
absence process; and









(d) that the designated authority provide for 
the timely exchange of relevant informa
tion with other participants in the criminal 
justice system and make information about 
temporary absence programs and policies 
available to prisoners, victims and the 
public.









Designated Authority






Designation


7.2 (1) The lieutenant governor of a prov
ince may designate any persons or organiza
tions to be responsible for authorizing tempo
rary absences under this Act for prisoners in 
that province.







Authoriza-
tion of 
provincial 
parole board


(2) Where a provincial parole board has 
been established for a province, the lieutenant 
governor of the province may order that no 
absence of a prisoner without escort be 
authorized from a prison in the province 
except by the provincial parole board.










Authorization of Absence






Authoriza-
tion of 
temporary 
absence


7.3 (1) A designated authority may autho
rize a prisoner to be absent from prison with or 
without escort, subject to any conditions that 
the authority considers appropriate, where it is 
necessary or desirable in the authority's 
opinion










(a) for medical or humanitarian reasons;









(b) in order to facilitate the prisoner's 
rehabilitation or reintegration into the com
munity; or









(c) for any other purpose, consistent with 
the purpose and principles set out in section 
7 and 7.1, that may be established by the 
laws of the province respecting the authori
zation of temporary absences of prisoners 
who have contravened provincial law.






Eligibility 
criteria


(2) In authorizing a temporary absence, the 
designated authority must apply the criteria, if 
any, established by the laws of the province 
respecting eligibility for temporary absence of 
prisoners who have contravened provincial 
law.







Duration of 
absence


7.4 (1) A temporary absence may be 
authorized for a maximum period of sixty 
days and may be renewed by the designated 
authority for one or more sixty-day periods on 
reassessment of the case.







Absence for 
medical 
reasons


(2) A temporary absence for medical rea
sons may be authorized for an unlimited 
period.










Suspension, Cancellation and Revocation






Grounds


7.5 A designated authority may suspend, 
cancel or revoke a temporary absence, before 
or after it begins, if










(a) it is considered necessary and justified 
to prevent a breach of a condition of the 
absence or where a breach has occurred;









(b) the grounds for authorizing the absence 
have changed or no longer exist; or









(c) the case has been reassessed, based on 
information that could not reasonably have 
been provided when the absence was autho
rized.






Apprehen-
sion and 
recommittal


7.6 (1) A designated authority who sus
pends, cancels or revokes a prisoner's tempo
rary absence, or a person designated by that 
authority, may have a warrant or notice of 
suspension, cancellation or revocation issued 
for his or her apprehension and recommittal.







Execution of 
warrant


(2) A peace officer who is given a warrant 
or notice issued under this section, or an 
electronically transmitted copy of such a 
warrant or notice, must execute it in any place 
in Canada as though the warrant had been 
originally issued or subsequently endorsed by 
a justice or other lawful authority having 
jurisdiction in that place.







Arrest without 
warrant


(3) A peace officer may arrest a person 
without a warrant or notice and remand the 
person into custody if the peace officer 
believes on reasonable grounds that a warrant 
or notice has been issued in respect of that 
person under this section and is still in force.







Where arrest 
made


(4) Where a person has been arrested 
pursuant to subsection (3), the warrant or 
notice, or an electronically transmitted copy 
of the warrant or notice, must be executed 
within forty-eight hours after the arrest is 
made, failing which the person must be 
released.
