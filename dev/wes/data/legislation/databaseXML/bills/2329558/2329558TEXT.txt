4. Section 753 of the Act and the heading 
before it are replaced by the following:










Dangerous Offenders and Long-Term 
Offenders






Application 
for remand 
for assessment


752.1 (1) Where an offender is convicted of 
a serious personal injury offence or an offence 
referred to in paragraph 753.1(2)(a) and, 
before sentence is imposed on the offender, on 
application by the prosecution, the court is of 
the opinion that there are reasonable grounds 
to believe that the offender might be found to 
be a dangerous offender under section 753 or 
a long-term offender under section 753.1, the 
court may, by order in writing, remand the 
offender, for a period not exceeding sixty 
days, to the custody of the person that the court 
directs and who can perform an assessment, or 
can have an assessment performed by experts. 
The assessment is to be used as evidence in an 
application under section 753 or 753.1.







Report


(2) The person to whom the offender is 
remanded shall file a report of the assessment 
with the court not later than fifteen days after 
the end of the assessment period and make 
copies of it available to the prosecutor and 
counsel for the offender.







Application 
for finding 
that an 
offender is a 
dangerous 
offender


753. (1) The court may, on application 
made under this Part following the filing of an 
assessment report under subsection 752.1(2), 
find the offender to be a dangerous offender if 
it is satisfied










(a) that the offence for which the offender 
has been convicted is a serious personal 
injury offence described in paragraph (a) of 
the definition of that expression in section 
752 and the offender constitutes a threat to 
the life, safety or physical or mental 
well-being of other persons on the basis of 
evidence establishing









(i) a pattern of repetitive behaviour by the 
offender, of which the offence for which 
he or she has been convicted forms a part, 
showing a failure to restrain his or her 
behaviour and a likelihood of causing 
death or injury to other persons, or 
inflicting severe psychological damage 
on other persons, through failure in the 
future to restrain his or her behaviour,









(ii) a pattern of persistent aggressive 
behaviour by the offender, of which the 
offence for which he or she has been 
convicted forms a part, showing a 
substantial degree of indifference on the 
part of the offender respecting the 
reasonably foreseeable consequences to 
other persons of his or her behaviour, or









(iii) any behaviour by the offender, 
associated with the offence for which he 
or she has been convicted, that is of such 
a brutal nature as to compel the 
conclusion that the offender's behaviour 
in the future is unlikely to be inhibited by 
normal standards of behavioural 
restraint; or









(b) that the offence for which the offender 
has been convicted is a serious personal 
injury offence described in paragraph (b) of 
the definition of that expression in section 
752 and the offender, by his or her conduct 
in any sexual matter including that involved 
in the commission of the offence for which 
he or she has been convicted, has shown a 
failure to control his or her sexual impulses 
and a likelihood of causing injury, pain or 
other evil to other persons through failure in 
the future to control his or her sexual 
impulses.






Time for 
making 
application


(2) An application under subsection (1) 
must be made before sentence is imposed on 
the offender unless










(a) before the imposition of sentence, the 
prosecution gives notice to the offender of 
a possible intention to make an application 
under section 752.1 and an application 
under subsection (1) not later than six 
months after that imposition; and









(b) at the time of the application under 
subsection (1) that is not later than six 
months after the imposition of sentence, it 
is shown that relevant evidence that was not 
reasonably available to the prosecution at 
the time of the imposition of sentence 
became available in the interim.






Application 
for remand 
for assessment 
after 
imposition of 
sentence


(3) Notwithstanding subsection 752.1(1), 
an application under that subsection may be 
made after the imposition of sentence or after 
an offender begins to serve the sentence in a 
case to which paragraphs (2)(a) and (b) apply.







If offender 
found to be 
dangerous 
offender


(4) If the court finds an offender to be a 
dangerous offender, it shall impose a sentence 
of detention in a penitentiary for an 
indeterminate period.







If application 
made after 
sentencing


(4.1) If the application was made after the 
offender begins to serve the sentence in a case 
to which paragraphs (2)(a) and (b) apply, the 
sentence of detention in a penitentiary for an 
indeterminate period referred to in subsection 
(4) replaces the sentence that was imposed for 
the offence for which the offender was 
convicted.







If offender not 
found to be 
dangerous 
offender


(5) If the court does not find an offender to 
be a dangerous offender,










(a) the court may treat the application as an 
application to find the offender to be a 
long-term offender, section 753.1 applies to 
the application and the court may either find 
that the offender is a long-term offender or 
hold another hearing for that purpose; or









(b) the court may impose sentence for the 
offence for which the offender has been 
convicted.






Victim 
evidence


(6) Any evidence given during the hearing 
of an application made under subsection (1) 
by a victim of an offence for which the 
offender was convicted is deemed also to have 
been given during any hearing under 
paragraph (5)(a) held with respect to the 
offender.







Application 
for finding 
that an 
offender is a 
long-term 
offender


753.1 (1) The court may, on application 
made under this Part following the filing of an 
assessment report under subsection 752.1(2), 
find an offender to be a long-term offender if 
it is satisfied that










(a) it would be appropriate to impose a 
sentence of imprisonment of two years or 
more for the offence for which the offender 
has been convicted;









(b) there is a substantial risk that the 
offender will reoffend; and









(c) there is a reasonable possibility of 
eventual control of the risk in the 
community.






Substantial 
risk


(2) The court shall be satisfied that there is 
a substantial risk that the offender will 
reoffend if










(a) the offender has been convicted of an 
offence under section 151 (sexual 
interference), 152 (invitation to sexual 
touching) or 153 (sexual exploitation), 
subsection 173(2) (exposure) or section 271 
(sexual assault), 272 (sexual assault with a 
weapon) or 273 (aggravated sexual assault), 
or has engaged in serious conduct of a 
sexual nature in the commission of another 
offence of which the offender has been 
convicted; and









(b) the offender









(i) has shown a pattern of repetitive 
behaviour, of which the offence for 
which he or she has been convicted forms 
a part, that shows a likelihood of the 
offender's causing death or injury to 
other persons or inflicting severe 
psychological damage on other persons, 
or









(ii) by conduct in any sexual matter 
including that involved in the 
commission of the offence for which the 
offender has been convicted, has shown 
a likelihood of causing injury, pain or 
other evil to other persons in the future 
through similar offences.






If offender 
found to be 
long-term 
offender


(3) Subject to subsections (3.1), (4) and (5), 
if the court finds an offender to be a long-term 
offender, it shall










(a) impose a sentence for the offence for 
which the offender has been convicted, 
which sentence must be a minimum 
punishment of imprisonment for a term of 
two years; and









(b) order the offender to be supervised in the 
community, for a period not exceeding ten 
years, in accordance with section 753.2 and 
the Corrections and Conditional Release 
Act.






Exception - 
if application 
made after 
sentencing


(3.1) The court may not impose a sentence 
under paragraph (3)(a) and the sentence that 
was imposed for the offence for which the 
offender was convicted stands despite the 
offender's being found to be a long-term 
offender, if the application was one that










(a) was made after the offender begins to 
serve the sentence in a case to which 
paragraphs 753(2)(a) and (b) apply; and









(b) was treated as an application under this 
section further to the court deciding to do so 
under paragraph 753(5)(a).






Exception - 
life sentence


(4) The court shall not make an order under 
paragraph (3)(b) if the offender has been 
sentenced to life imprisonment.







Exception to 
length of 
supervision 
where new 
declaration


(5) If the offender commits another offence 
while required to be supervised by an order 
made under paragraph (3)(b), and is thereby 
found to be a long-term offender, the periods 
of supervision to which the offender is subject 
at any particular time must not total more than 
ten years.







If offender not 
found to be 
long-term 
offender


(6) If the court does not find an offender to 
be a long-term offender, the court shall impose 
sentence for the offence for which the offender 
has been convicted.







Long-term 
supervision


753.2 (1) Subject to subsection (2), an 
offender who is required to be supervised by 
an order made under paragraph 753.1(3)(b) 
shall be supervised in accordance with the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act 
when the offender has finished serving










(a) the sentence for the offence for which 
the offender has been convicted; and









(b) all other sentences for offences for 
which the offender is convicted and for 
which sentence of a term of imprisonment 
is imposed on the offender, either before or 
after the conviction for the offence referred 
to in paragraph (a).






Non-carceral 
sentences


(2) A sentence imposed on an offender 
referred to in subsection (1), other than a 
sentence that requires imprisonment of the 
offender, is to be served concurrently with the 
long-term supervision ordered under 
paragraph 753.1(3)(b).







Application 
for reduction 
in period of 
long-term 
supervision


(3) An offender who is required to be 
supervised, a member of the National Parole 
Board, or, on approval of that Board, the 
parole supervisor, as that expression is defined 
in subsection 134.2(2) of the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act, of the offender, may 
apply to a superior court of criminal 
jurisdiction for an order reducing the period of 
long-term supervision or terminating it on the 
ground that the offender no longer presents a 
substantial risk of reoffending and thereby 
being a danger to the community. The onus of 
proving that ground is on the applicant.







Notice to 
Attorney 
General


(4) The applicant must give notice of an 
application under subsection (3) to the 
Attorney General at the time the application is 
made.







Breach of 
order of 
long-term 
supervision


753.3 (1) An offender who is required to be 
supervised by an order made under paragraph 
753.1(3)(b) and who, without reasonable 
excuse, fails or refuses to comply with that 
order is guilty of an indictable offence and 
liable to imprisonment for a term not 
exceeding ten years.







Where 
accused may 
be tried and 
punished


(2) An accused who is charged with an 
offence under subsection (1) may be tried and 
punished by any court having jurisdiction to 
try that offence in the place where the offence 
is alleged to have been committed or in the 
place where the accused is found, is arrested 
or is in custody, but if the place where the 
accused is found, is arrested or is in custody is 
outside the province in which the offence is 
alleged to have been committed, no 
proceedings in respect of that offence shall be 
instituted in that place without the consent of 
the Attorney General of that province.







Where new 
offence


753.4 (1) Where an offender who is 
required to be supervised by an order made 
under paragraph 753.1(3)(b) commits one or 
more offences under this or any other Act and 
a court imposes a sentence of imprisonment 
for the offence or offences, the long-term 
supervision is interrupted until the offender 
has finished serving all the sentences, unless 
the court orders its termination.







Reduction in 
term of 
long-term 
supervision


(2) A court that imposes a sentence of 
imprisonment under subsection (1) may order 
a reduction in the length of the period of the 
offender's long-term supervision.










5. Sections 755 to 757 of the Act are 
replaced by the following:







Evidence of 
character


757. Without prejudice to the right of the 
offender to tender evidence as to his or her 
character and repute, evidence of character 
and repute may, if the court thinks fit, be

supervision of a long-term offender, on any
