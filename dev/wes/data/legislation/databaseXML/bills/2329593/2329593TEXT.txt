2. (1) Section 6 of the Income Tax Act is 
amended by adding the following after 
subsection (16):







Definitions


(17) The definitions in this subsection apply 
in this subsection and subsection (18).







``disability 
policy''
« police 
d'assurance-
invalidité »


``disability policy'' means a group disability 
insurance policy that provides for periodic 
payments to individuals in respect of the 
loss of remuneration from an office or em
ployment.







``employer''
« employeur »


``employer'' of an individual includes a for
mer employer of the individual.







``top-up 
disability 
payment''
« paiement 
compensatoi-
re pour 
invalidité »


``top-up disability payment'' in respect of an 
individual means a payment made by an 
employer of the individual as a conse
quence of the insolvency of an insurer that 
was obligated to make payments to the indi
vidual under a disability policy where










(a) the payment is made to an insurer so 
that periodic payments made to the 
individual under the policy will not be 
reduced because of the insolvency, or 
will be reduced by a lesser amount, or









(b) the following conditions are satisfied:









(i) the payment is made to the individ
ual to replace, in whole or in part, 
periodic payments that would have 
been made under the policy to the 
individual but for the insolvency, and









(ii) the payment is made pursuant to an 
arrangement under which the individ
ual is required to reimburse the pay
ment to the extent that the individual 
subsequently receives an amount from 
an insurer in respect of the portion of 
the periodic payments that the pay
ment was intended to replace.









For the purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b), 
an insurance policy that replaces a disabil
ity policy is deemed to be the same policy 
as, and a continuation of, the disability 
policy that was replaced.

received or enjoyed by the individual;









(b) the payment is, for the purpose of 
paragraph (1)(f), deemed not to be a con
tribution made by the employer to or under 
the disability insurance plan of which the 
disability policy in respect of which the 
payment is made is or was a part; and









(c) where the payment is made to the 
individual, it is, for the purpose of para
graph (1)(f), deemed to be an amount 
payable to the individual pursuant to the 
plan.  









(2) Subsection (1) applies to payments 
made after August 10, 1994.

an employer or former employer of the

described in subparagraph (b)(ii) of the 
definition ``top-up disability payment'' 
in subsection 6(17), and
