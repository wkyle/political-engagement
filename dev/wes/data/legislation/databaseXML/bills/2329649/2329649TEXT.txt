Preamble


WHEREAS, after extensive national 
consultations, the Government of Canada has 
determined that it is desirable to establish a 
commission to provide independent advice on 
improvements, modernization and reform of 
the law of Canada, which advice would be 
based on the knowledge and experience of a 
wide range of groups and individuals;










AND WHEREAS the Government adopted 
the recommendations arising from those 
consultations that the commission should be 
guided by the following principles, namely,










the commission's work should be open to 
and inclusive of all Canadians and the 
results of that work should be accessible 
and understandable,









the commission should adopt a 
multidisciplinary approach to its work that 
views the law and the legal system in a 
broad social and economic context,









the commission should be responsive and 
accountable by cooperating and forging 
partnerships with a wide range of interested 
groups and individuals, including the 
academic community,









the commission should employ modern 
technology when appropriate and be 
innovative in its research methods, its 
consultation processes, its management 
practices and its communications in order 
to achieve efficiency in its operations and 
effectiveness in its results, and









the commission should take account of 
cost-effectiveness and the impact of the law 
on different groups and individuals in 
formulating its recommendations;









NOW, THEREFORE, Her Majesty, by and 
with the advice and consent of the Senate and
