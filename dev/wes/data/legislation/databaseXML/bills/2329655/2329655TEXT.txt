to as the ``old class'') become included at any 
time (in this subsection referred to as the 
``transfer time'') in another prescribed class 
(in this subsection referred to as the ``new 
class''), for the purpose of determining at any 
subsequent time the undepreciated capital 
cost to the taxpayer of depreciable property of 
the old class and the new class










(a) the value of A in the definition 
``undepreciated capital cost'' in subsection 
(21) shall be determined as if each of those 
depreciable properties were

before the subsequent time, and

total depreciation allowed to the taxpayer 
for property of the old class before the 
subsequent time, and added in computing 
the total depreciation allowed to the 
taxpayer for property of the new class 
before the subsequent time, the greater of









(i) the amount determined by the formula









A - B

property included in a separate 
prescribed class, and









(B) the rate allowed by the regulations 
made for the purpose of paragraph 
20(1)(a) in respect of that separate 
class had been the effective rate that 
was used by the taxpayer to calculate 
a deduction under that paragraph in 
respect of the old class for the year.

adding the following after subsection (7.4):







Deemed 
capital cost

respect of costs incurred or to be incurred by 
the recipient of the payment

acquired the property at a capital cost 
equal to the portion of that payment made 
by the taxpayer that can reasonably be 
regarded as being in respect of those

by the taxpayer is deemed to be the later 
of the time the payment is made and the 
time at which those costs are incurred;

paragraph did not apply, not be included 
in the capital cost to the taxpayer of 
depreciable property of a prescribed 
class,









the taxpayer is deemed to have acquired the 
property at that time at a capital cost equal 
to the amount of the cost;









(c) where a taxpayer acquires an intangible 
property as a consequence of making a 
payment to which paragraph (a) applies or 
incurring a cost to which paragraph (b) 
applies,









(i) the property referred to in paragraph 
(a) or (b) is deemed to include the 
intangible property, and









(ii) the portion of the capital cost referred 
to in paragraph (a) or (b) that applies to 
the intangible property is deemed to be 
the amount determined by the formula









A x B/C










where









A	is the lesser of the amount of the 
payment made or cost incurred and 
the amount determined for C,









B	is the fair market value of the 
intangible property at the time the 
payment was made or the cost was 
incurred, and









C	is the fair market value at the time 
the payment was made or the cost 
was incurred of all intangible 
properties acquired as a 
consequence of making the 
payment or incurring the cost; and
