Her Majesty, by and with the advice and 
consent of the Senate and House of Commons 
of Canada, enacts as follows:









1. (1) Subsection 486(1.1) of the Criminal 
Code is replaced by the following:







Protection of 
witnesses


(1.1) For the purposes of subsections (1) and 
(2.3) and for greater certainty, the ``proper 
administration of justice'' includes ensuring 
that the interests of witnesses are safeguarded 
in proceedings in which the accused is charged 
with a sexual offence, an offence against any 
of sections 271, 272 and 273 or an offence in 
which violence against the person is alleged to 
have been used, threatened or attempted.










(2) Subsection 486(2.3) of the Act is 
replaced by the following:







Accused not 
to cross-
examine 
witnesses


(2.3) In proceedings referred to in 
subsection (1.1), the accused shall not 
personally cross-examine a witness unless the 
presiding judge, provincial court judge or 
justice is of the opinion that the proper 
administration of justice requires the accused 
to personally conduct the cross-examination 
and, where the accused is not personally 
conducting the cross-examination, the 
presiding judge, provincial court judge or 
justice shall appoint counsel for the purpose of 
conducting the cross-examination.
