interest of the bankrupt in the property in 
respect of which the taxes were imposed as 
declared by the trustee;









(g)  the landlord for arrears of rent for a 
period of three months immediately 
preceding the bankruptcy and accelerated

following the bankruptcy if entitled thereto 
under the lease, but the total amount so

thereunder;

pay to Her Majesty amounts that have been 
deducted or withheld, rateably;









(j)  claims resulting from injuries to 
employees of the bankrupt in respect of 
which the provisions of any Act respecting 
workers' compensation do not apply, but 
only to the extent of moneys received from 
persons or companies guaranteeing the 
bankrupt against damages resulting from 
those injuries; and









(k)  in the case of a bankrupt who became 
bankrupt before the prescribed date, claims 
of the Crown not previously mentioned in 
paragraphs (a) to (j) , in right of Canada or 
any province, rateably notwithstanding any 
statutory preference to the contrary.
