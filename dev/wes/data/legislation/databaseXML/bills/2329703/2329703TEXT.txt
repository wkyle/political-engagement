c. 51; 1993, 
cc. 8, 28


Her Majesty, by and with the advice and 
consent of the Senate and House of Commons 
of Canada, enacts as follows:









1. (1) Subsection 16(3) of the Divorce Act 
is replaced by the following:







Application 
by other 
person


(3) A person, other than a spouse or 
grandparent , may not make an application 
under subsection (1) or (2) without leave of the 
court.










(2) Subsection 16(5) of the Act is replaced 
by the following:







Access


(5) Unless the court orders otherwise, a 
spouse or grandparent  who is granted access 
to a child of the marriage has the right to make 
inquiries, and to be given information, as to 
the health, education and welfare of the child.










(3) Subsections 16(9) and (10) of the Act 
are replaced by the following:







Past conduct


(9) In making an order under this section, 
the court shall not take into consideration the 
past conduct of any person unless the conduct 
is relevant to the ability of that person to act as 
a parent or grandparent  of a child.







Maximum 
contact


(10) In making an order under this section, 
the court shall give effect to the principle that 
a child of the marriage should have as much 
contact with each spouse and each 
grandparent  as is consistent with the best 
interests of the child and, for that purpose, 
shall take into consideration the willingness of 
the person for whom custody is sought to 
facilitate such contact.










2. (1) Subsection 17(2) of the Act is 
replaced by the following:







Application 
by other 
person


(2) A person, other than a former spouse or 
grandparent,  may not make an application 
under paragraph (1)(b) without leave of the 
court.










(2) Subsection 17(9) of the Act is replaced 
by the following:







Maximum 
contact


(9) In making a variation order varying a 
custody order, the court shall give effect to the 
principle that a child of the marriage should 
have as much contact with each former spouse 
and each grandparent  as is consistent with the 
best interests of the child and, for that purpose, 
where the variation order would grant custody 
of the child to a person who does not currently 
have custody, the court shall take into 
consideration the willingness of that person to 
facilitate such contact.







Review after 
four years


3. (1) On the expiration of four years after 
the coming into force of this Act, the 
provisions contained herein shall be 
referred to such committee of the House of 
Commons, of the Senate, or of both Houses 
of Parliament as may be designated or 
established by Parliament for that purpose.







Report


(2) The committee designated or 
established by Parliament for the purpose 
of subsection (1) shall, as soon as 
practicable, undertake a comprehensive 
review of the provisions and operation of 
this Act and shall, within six months after 
the review is undertaken or within such 
further time as the House of Commons may 
authorize, submit a report to Parliament 
thereon including such recommendations 
pertaining to the continuation of those 
provisions and changes required therein as 
the committee may wish to make.
