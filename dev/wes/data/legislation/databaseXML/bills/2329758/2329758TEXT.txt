Her Majesty, by and with the advice and 
consent of the Senate and House of Commons 
of Canada, enacts as follows:









1. The Competition Act is amended by 
adding the following after section 50:







Competition 
by supplier: 
definitions


50.1 (1) In this section,







``affiliate''
« personnes 
affiliées » ou 
« filiale »


``affiliate'' has the meaning given to it in 
subsection 77(5); and







``market 
area''
« secteur de 
marché »


``market area'' means an area in which a seller 
customarily sells a product at retail or offers 
it for sale at retail.







Fair price to 
competing 
retailer


(2) Every vertically integrated supplier who 
manufactures and sells a product at retail, 
either directly or through an affiliate, and also 
sells the product or a similar product to a 
purchaser who is not an affiliate but who is in 
the business of selling the product at retail and 
who charges the purchaser a price that exceeds










(a) the supplier's own retail price in the 
same market area as that in which the 
purchaser customarily sells the product or 
offers it for sale, less









(i) its own cost of marketing at retail, and









(ii) its reasonable return on the retail sale,









in the case of a direct sale, or









(b) the price charged to the affiliate, in the 
case of a sale through an affiliate,









is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to 
imprisonment for a term not exceeding two 
years.







No lower 
return for 
supplier


(3) Notwithstanding subsection (1), a 
vertically integrated supplier is not required to 
sell a product to a retailer at a price that results 
in the supplier receiving a lower return on the 
retail sale of the product when sold by the 
supplier or its affiliate than the customer's 
return on the retail sale of the same product 
supplied by the supplier, in the same market 
area.  










2. Section 78 of the Act is amended by 
deleting the word ``and'' at the end of 
paragraph (h), by adding the word ``and'' 
at the end of paragraph (i) and by adding 
the following after paragraph (i):










(j) being a vertically integrated supplier, 
coerces or attempts to coerce a customer 
who competes with the supplier at the retail 
level in the same market area, in relation to 
the establishment of the customer's retail 
price or pricing policy.
