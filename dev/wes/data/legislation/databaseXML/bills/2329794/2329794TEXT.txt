Her Majesty, by and with the advice and 
consent of the Senate and House of Commons 
of Canada, enacts as follows:









1. The Criminal Code is amended by 
adding the following after section 727:







Order 
respecting 
change of 
name


727.1 (1) Where an offender is convicted of 
first degree murder, second degree murder or 
an offence under section 273 (aggravated 
sexual assault), the court that sentences the 
offender, in addition to any other punishment 
that may be imposed for that offence or any 
other condition prescribed in the order of 
discharge, shall make an order prohibiting the 
offender from changing his or her name by 
application under provincial law or informally 
by assuming another name.







Conditions or 
exemptions


(2) The court may make the order of 
prohibition subject to any conditions or 
exemptions that it directs.







Duration of 
order


(3) The prohibition may be for life or for any 
shorter duration that the court considers 
desirable and begins on the date on which the 
order is made.







Appropriate 
court


(4) A court that makes an order of 
prohibition or, where the court is for any 
reason unable to act, another court of 
equivalent jurisdiction in the same province 
may, on application of the offender or the 
prosecutor, require the offender to appear 
before it at any time.







Variation of 
conditions


(5) After hearing the parties on an 
application under subsection (3), the court 
may vary the conditions prescribed in the 
order if, in the opinion of the court, the 
variation is desirable because of changed 
circumstances.







Offence


(6) Every person who is bound by an order 
of prohibition and who does not comply with 
the order is guilty of










(a) an indictable offence and is liable to 
imprisonment for a term not exceeding two 
years; or









(b) an offence punishable on summary 
conviction.
