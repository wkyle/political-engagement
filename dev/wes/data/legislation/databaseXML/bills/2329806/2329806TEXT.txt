45-46 Elizabeth II, 1996-97










The House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-409









An Act to amend the Divorce Act (definition 
of ``child'')







Preamble


 Whereas on November 20, 1989, the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child was 
adopted in the United Nations General 
Assembly;










 Whereas the United Nations Convention 
on the Rights of the Child has been ratified by 
Canada on December 13, 1991.










 And Wheareas the convention proposes a 
definition of ``child'' that should be applied 
uniformly throughout federal legislation;










Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:










 






R.S., cc. 3, 27 
(2nd Supp.); 
1990, c. 18; 
1992, c. 51; 
1993, cc. 8, 
28


1. (1) The definition of ``child of the 
marriage'' in subsection 2(1) of the Divorce 
Act is replaced by the following:







``child of the 
marriage''
« enfant à 
charge »


``child of the marriage'' means a child of two 
spouses or former spouses who, at the 
material time, is under the age of eighteen 
years.










(2) The Act is amended by adding the 
following after paragraph 2(2)(b):










(c) who is eighteen years of age or over and 
under their charge but unable, by reason of 
illness, disability or other cause, to 
withdraw from their charge or to obtain the 
necessaries of life.
