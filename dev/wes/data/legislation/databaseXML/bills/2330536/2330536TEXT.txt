WHEREAS all Canadians are entitled to

federal legislation and provincial legislation is 
essential and lies in an interpretation of 
federal legislation that is compatible with the

may be;










 WHEREAS the full development of our 
two major legal traditions gives Canadians a 
window on the world and facilitates 
exchanges with the vast majority of other 
countries;

to property and civil rights, is the law that 
completes federal legislation when applied in 
a province, unless otherwise provided by law;










 WHEREAS the objective of the 
Government of Canada is to facilitate access 
to federal legislation that takes into account 
the common law and civil law traditions, in its 
English and French versions;

Canada has established a harmonization 
program of federal legislation with the civil 
law of the Province of Quebec to ensure that
