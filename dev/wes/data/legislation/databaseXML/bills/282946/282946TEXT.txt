adding the following in alphabetical order:







``artificial 
propagation''
« reproductio
n artificielle »


``artificial propagation'' means growing plant 
specimens from seed, cutting, callous 
tissue, spores or other propagules under 
controlled conditions from stock 
established and augmented from time to 
time from the wild as necessary to minimize 
problems with inbreeding, without 
detriment to the survival of the species in 
the wild, by a means that permits indefinite 
propagation of the species, and ``artificially 
propagated'' has a corresponding meaning;







``captive 
breeding''
« élevage en 
captivité »


``captive breeding'' means a process










(a) that results in birth or other 
production of eggs, seeds or offspring of 
a species,









(b) that is carried out in a controlled 
environment from parents that mated or 
transmitted gametes in the controlled 
environment,









(c) that uses stock established and 
augmented from time to time from the 
wild as necessary to minimize problems 
with inbreeding, without detriment to the 
survival of the species in the wild, and









(d) that has demonstrated its capability of 
reliably producing second-generation 
offspring,









and ``bred in captivity'' has a corresponding 
meaning;






``CITES''
« CITES »


``CITES'' means the international body of that 
name that administers the Convention;







``country of 
origin''
« pays 
d'origine »


``country of origin'' means the country from 
which an animal or plant was originally 
moved for the purposes of export and does 
not include a country to which it has been 
moved temporarily and held for the purpose 
of re-exportation;







``Management 
Authority''
« autorité de 
gestion »


``Management Authority'' means the 
authority established pursuant to section 
10.9;







``personal 
effects''

``personal effects'' has the meaning given to 
that term by the regulations;







``Scientific 
Authority''
« autorité 
scientifique »


``Scientific Authority'' means the authority 
established pursuant to section 10.91;







``zoo''
« zoo »


``zoo'' means a publicly or privately owned 
collection of wild or domesticated animals 
that is kept in a permanent location and that 
is open to the public on a full-time or 
occasional basis, with or without the 
payment of a fee, and includes collections 
known as zoos, safari parks, wildlife parks, 
bird gardens, marine parks, aquaria, reptile 
houses and insectariums.  










2. The Act is amended by adding the 
following after section 4:










APPLICATION






Personal

the import and export of animals and plants 
that are a part of the personal effects of a 
person entering or leaving Canada, whether or 
not they accompany the person.  










3. The Act is amended by adding the 
following after section 10:







Limitations on 
import


10.1 (1) Notwithstanding section 10 or the 
regulations, no person shall import into 
Canada any animal or plant that is listed in the

Minister is satisfied that the import is to be










(a) for the purpose of transferring the 
animal or plant from one zoo to another;









(b) for scientific research by an institution 
that has the protection of animals and plants 
as its primary objective and that will use the 
import toward that objective; or

of the animal or plant in a licensed captive 
breeding or artificial propagation 
operation.

Canada;









(e) the person importing the animal or plant 
will, in the case of an animal, arrange at all

for its care and cultivation; and
