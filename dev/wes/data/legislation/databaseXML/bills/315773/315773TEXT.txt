House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-439









An Act to amend the Canada-Israel Free Trade 
Agreement Implementation Act







Preamble


Whereas the Government of Canada and 
the Government of the State of Israel entered 
into a Free Trade Agreement that came into 
force on January 1, 1997;










 Whereas the Canada-Israel Free Trade 
Agreement provides that neither Party may 
increase any existing customs duty, or adopt 
any customs duty, or any charge of equivalent 
effect on an originating good;










 Whereas in Europe goods originating from 
Israeli settlements in the West Bank, the Gaza 
Strip, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights 
may become subject to the full rate of customs 
duties rather than duties at the preferential 
tariff treatment accorded by the European 
Union-Israel Association Agreements;










 And Whereas it is desirable that Canada 
adopt measures similar to those taken by the 
European Union;







1996, c. 33


Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and the 
House of Commons of Canada, enacts as 
follows:










 









1. Subsection 2(1) of the Canada-Israel 
Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act 
is amended by adding the following in 
alphabetical order:







``settlements''
« colonies de 
peuplement »


``settlements'' means the settlements placed 
under Israeli administration since 1967 in 
the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, East 
Jerusalem and the Golan Heights.  










2. The Act is amended by adding the 
following after section 4:










CONSULTATION






Consultation


4.1 The Minister shall undertake 
consultations with the Government of the 
State of Israel for the purpose of having the 
Agreement amended to exclude goods 
originating from the settlements from the list 
of goods entitled to the lower rates of customs 
duty.
