BILL C-237









An Act to amend the Immigration and 
Refugee Protection Act







2001, c. 27


Her Majesty, by and with the advice and 
consent of the Senate and House of Commons 
of Canada, enacts as follows:









1. The Immigration and Refugee 
Protection Act is amended by adding the 
following after section 105:







Definition of 
``source 
country''


105.1 (1) For the purposes of this section, 
``source country'' means, in relation to a 
refugee claimant, their country of nationality 
or, if they do not have a country of nationality, 
their country of former habitual residence.







Deportation 
of refugee 
claimant


(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of 
this Act, an officer may order that a refugee 
claimant be deported from Canada to their 
source country if










(a) there has been a clear admission by the 
claimant that they have no fear of 
persecution in their source country;









(b) the claimant has failed to produce 
acceptable documentation establishing 
their identity and the officer is unable to 
determine a credible reason for the lack of 
such documentation, taking into account 
the statements of the claimant, any other 
relevant evidence ascertained by the officer 
and such factors as the political situation in 
the source country and the means of 
transportation that conveyed the claimant 
to Canada;









(c) there is conclusive evidence that the 
claimant has engaged in serious criminality 
within the meaning of subsection 36(1), is 
engaged in organized criminality within the 
meaning of subsection 37(1), or is a 
member of a terrorist group as defined in 
subsection 83.01(1) of the Criminal Code; 
or









(d) the source country is prescribed by 
regulations made under subsection (4) as a 
country that respects human rights.






Deportation 
after 
investigation


(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of 
this Act, an officer may, after thirty days have 
elapsed since a claim for refugee protection 
was made, order that the refugee claimant be 
deported from Canada to their source country 
if it is clear from all relevant evidence 
ascertained by the best efforts of the officer 
during that period, including any statements 
of the claimant, that the claimant left their 
source country and seeks to remain in Canada 
solely for economic reasons.







Regulations


(4) The Governor in Council shall, within 
six months after this section comes into force, 
make regulations prescribing, for the purposes 
of paragraph (2)(d), countries that respect 
human rights.
