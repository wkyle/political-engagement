(process for approval of new drugs)







R.S., c. F-27


Her Majesty, by and with the advice and 
consent of the Senate and House of Commons 
of Canada, enacts as follows:









1. Section 30 of the Food and Drugs Act is 
amended by adding the following after 
subsection (1):







Criteria for 
new drug 
approval 
regulations


(1.1) Regulations made under paragraph 
(1)(o) that relate to the process for the testing 
and approval of new drugs must










(a) establish a process that provides for the 
process of application, review and 
notification to the applicant of a decision as 
to whether or not a new drug will be 
approved within a period of not more than 
300 days excluding time taken by the 
applicant to provide information requested 
for the review process;









(b) provide an opportunity for the applicant 
to request that the application be given 
priority in review;









(c) set out the criteria against which a 
request for priority review will be 
considered;









(d) set out the stages of the review process 
and time guidelines for the completion of 
each stage of the process;









(e) provide a process for the applicant to be 
notified forthwith if the guideline for any 
stage is exceeded by more than ten percent 
and require reasons to be given to the 
applicant for the delay;









(f) ensure proper consideration of similar 
processes established outside Canada and in 
particular ensure that the process is no less 
efficient and timely than the process 
established for the approval of new drugs in 
the European Community by the European 
Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal 
Products;









(g) provide for the assignment of sufficient 
professional, scientific and other technical 
and support staff to ensure that the 
guidelines are adhered to;









(h) establish rules to ensure that the 
scientific staff are not subjected to any 
pressure to approve or not approve a drug on 
the basis of any factor that is not directly 
supportive of the public interest in having 
access to safe, effective and economical 
drugs; and









(i) prescribe the form and content of the 
reports to be made by the Minister to 
Parliament under subsection (1.2).






Report to 
Parliament


(1.2) The Minister shall, on any of the first 
three sitting days following April 1 of every 
year, cause to be laid before the Senate and the 
House of Commons a report showing, in 
respect of the preceding year,










(a) the number of applications for the 
approval of a new drug for which the review 
has been completed and the decision made 
and transmitted to the applicant;









(b) the average time for the review in each 
case from the date of receipt of the 
application to the date on which the 
applicant was sent notice of the decision;









(c) the number of applications for which the 
time mentioned in paragraph (b) exceeded 
the time set in the guidelines by more than 
ten per cent and the most common reasons 
for the excess time taken;









(d) the number of professional, scientific, 
technical and support employees assigned 
to the review process during the year; and









(e) any steps the Minister intends to take to 
improve the process in succeeding years.






Confidential 
information 
protected


(1.3) A report under subsection (1.2) must 
not contain any information whereby an 
applicant or a new drug may be identified.
