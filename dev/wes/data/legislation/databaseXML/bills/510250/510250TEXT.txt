2nd Session, 37th Parliament,
51 Elizabeth II, 2002 










House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-236









An Act to prohibit the use of chemical 
pesticides for non-essential purposes







Preamble


Whereas many chemical pesticides have 
been shown to be harmful to humans and 
domestic animals and some are carcinogenic;










 Whereas the use of chemical pesticides on 
home lawns and gardens and on recreational 
facilities such as parks and golf courses is 
particularly hazardous because of the 
likelihood of immediate and continuing use of 
the land by, and thus exposure of the chemical 
pesticide to, the residents of the home and 
users of the recreational facilities, who may 
include children, pregnant women and others 
who may be particularly sensitive, and 
domestic animals;










 Whereas such home and recreational use of 
pesticides tends to utilize heavier application 
rates than agricultural use;










 Whereas chemical pesticides have only 
been used for home and recreational facilities 
for a relatively short period of time and other 
non-toxic methods of pest and weed control 
have been used in the past and are still 
available;










 Whereas any advantage of such use of 
chemical pesticides is outweighed by the 
health and environmental risks;










 And Whereas more research is needed to 
determine which chemical pesticides are safe 
for home and recreational use;










Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:










 






R.S., c. P-9


1. The Pest Control Products Act is 
amended by adding the following after 
section 5:







Moratorium 
on home and 
recreational 
use


5.1 (1) With effect from April 22, 2003, 
which is recognized as Earth Day, no 
regulation made pursuant to this Act shall 
apply to the use of a control product:










(a) within a dwelling-house;









(b) on any parcel of land on which a 
dwelling-house is situated;









(c) on any place that is within one hundred 
metres of a parcel of land described in 
paragraph (b);









(d) in any school, hospital, office or similar 
building in which members of the public 
customarily stay for more than a day or 
work; or









(e) on any private or public land that is 
customarily used by members of the public 
as visitors, licensees or in any other 
authorized capacity for recreation or 
entertainment, including but not limited to 
parks and sports grounds.






Exception for 
agricultural 
buildings


(2) Paragraph (1)(c) does not apply to use in 
a building used for the husbandry of animals, 
the cultivation of plants or the storage, 
processing, packaging or distribution of plants 
or animals or products made primarily from 
plants or animals, or in the immediate vicinity 
of such a building.







Exception for 
scientifically 
approved 
products


(3) Subsection (1) does not apply to a 
regulation made on or after April 22, 2003 that 
approves the use of a control product in a place 
mentioned in subsection (1) if, before the 
regulation comes into effect:










(a) the Minister of Health has laid before 
each House of Parliament a draft for the 
regulation and the scientific and medical 
evidence on which the use of the control 
product in such a place has been determined 
to be safe for the health of humans and 
domestic animals that customarily reside in 
dwelling-houses; and









(b) the draft regulation and the scientific 
evidence have been referred to a standing 
committee of the House of Commons, and 
the standing committee has reported to the 
House its opinion that the proposed use of 
the control product in question is justified 
by the scientific evidence.
