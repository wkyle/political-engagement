BILL C-220









An Act to amend the Food and Drugs Act 
(genetically modified food)







R.S., c. F-27


Her Majesty, by and with the advice and 
consent of the Senate and House of Commons 
of Canada, enacts as follows:









1. Section 2 of the Food and Drugs Act is 
amended by adding the following in 
alphabetical order:







``genetically 
modified 
food''
« aliment 
transgénique 
»


``genetically modified food'' means a food 
that is derived from a plant, animal, 
microorganism or other biological entity 
capable of transferring or replicating 
genetic material, including sterile 
organisms, viruses and viroids when such 
entity possesses a novel combination of 
genetic material obtained through the use of 
modern biotechnology;







``modern 
biotechnology
''
« biotechnolo
gie moderne »


``modern biotechnology'' means the 
application of










(a) in vitro nucleic acid techniques, 
including recombinant deoxyribonucleic 
acid (DNA) and direct injection of 
nucleic acid into cells or organelles, or









(b) fusion of cells beyond the taxonomic 
family,









that overcome natural physiological 
reproductive or recombinant barriers and 
that are not techniques used in traditional 
breeding and selection;  










2. The Act is amended by adding the 
following after section 7:







Labelling of 
genetically 
modified food


7.1 (1) No person shall sell or offer for sale 
a food that contains more than one per cent of 
a genetically modified food, unless it is 
labelled with a statement










(a) that it is or contains an ingredient that is 
genetically modified; and









(b) which food or ingredient is derived from 
genetic modification.






Applies to 
sales at all 
levels


(2) Subsection (1) applies to food that is 
being sold or offered for sale at retail, at 
wholesale or between stages of production, 
processing or distribution.







Packaged 
foods


(3) In the case of food that is packaged in the 
way in which they will be sold or offered for 
sale, the labelling required by subsection (1) 
must be on each package that may be sold 
separately, in accordance with the regulations.







Bulk or 
unpackaged 
food


(4) In the case of food that is sold or offered 
for sale without being packaged, or in bulk, 
the labelling required by subsection (1) must 
be effected in statements in the documents of 
sale or on signs placed on or by the food, in 
accordance with the regulations.







Documentatio
n trail


7.2 Every person who contracts to purchase 
any food for the purpose of manufacture, 
processing, distribution, packaging or sale at 
wholesale or retail, shall










(a) obtain from the vendor a certificate in 
the prescribed form stating









(i) that the food will, at the time of 
delivery to the purchaser, be labelled in 
accordance with section 7.1, and









(ii) that the food has been grown, raised, 
produced, stored, pooled, transported, 
processed, tested and packaged in 
accordance with the regulations; and




















(b) obtain from the vendor copies of all 
documents relating to the application of 
section 7.1 to the food that have been 
generated by or supplied to the vendor and 
that relate to the ability of the purchaser to 
label the food in compliance with this Act 
when the food is subsequently sold or 
processed and sold by the purchaser.






Lists of 
genetically 
modified food


7.3 The Minister shall maintain, and make 
available for public inspection during normal 
business hours, including by electronic 
means, lists of foods that are being offered for 
sale in Canada that have a content of more 
than one percent of material that is genetically 
modified and shall provide copies thereof on 
request at a cost not exceeding ten cents per 
page.







Research


7.4 (1) The Minister shall cause research to 
be carried out into










(a) the general long-term effects of the 
consumption of genetically modified food 
on human health;









(b) the possibility of unexpected gene 
interaction in genetically modified foods;









(c) the possibility of novel genetic, 
biochemical, immunological or 
toxicological hazards arising from the 
consumption of genetically modified foods; 
and









(d) long-term animal feeding trials 
involving genetically modified feed.









(2) Using information from the labelling 
required by section 7.1, the Minister shall 
cause research and epidemiological studies to 
be carried out into the levels of consumption 
of genetically modified foods in Canada and 
the impact on human health of the genetically 
modified foods that are observed to have been 
purchased for consumption.










(3) The Minister shall cause information 
obtained from the labelling required by 
section 7.1 to be collected in the manner 
prescribed by the regulations and maintained 
for use in the post-release monitoring, tracing 
and reporting of future health problems.







Offences


7.5 No person shall










(a) make a false, misleading or incomplete 
statement on a label required by section 7.1 
or a certificate required by section 7.2;









(b) sell or offer for sale any food knowing 
that it bears or is accompanied by a 
statement described in paragraph (a); or

amended by adding the following after 
paragraph (j):










(j.1) prescribing the procedures that must be 
followed, precautions that must be taken 
and records that must be kept in the 
growing, raising, production, storage, 
pooling, transportation, processing, testing 
and packaging of foods or any thing that 
will become a food, in order to enable the 
content of genetically modified material in 
the food to be ascertainable at all times and 
to ensure the accuracy of the labelling 
required by section 7.1 and the certification 
required by section 7.2;









(j.2) defining the size, and location of a 
label that is required pursuant to section 7.1

unlikely to be a significant or essential part 
of a diet; and









(c) it is required as a condition of the 
exemption to be labelled to show that it has 
been exempted from the requirement to 
declare the genetically modified content.  






Coming into 
force


4. (1) This Act comes into effect on a day 
or days to be fixed by order of the Governor 
in Council.







Order 
respecting 
certain foods
