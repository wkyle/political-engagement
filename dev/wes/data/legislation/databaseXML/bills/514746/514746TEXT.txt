CHAPTER 29 











An Act respecting the protection of wildlife 
species at risk in Canada










[Assented to 12th December, 2002] 







Preamble


Recognizing that










Canada's natural heritage is an integral part 
of our national identity and history,









wildlife, in all its forms, has value in and of 
itself and is valued by Canadians for 
aesthetic, cultural, spiritual, recreational, 
educational, historical, economic, medical, 
ecological and scientific reasons,









Canadian wildlife species and ecosystems 
are also part of the world's heritage and the 
Government of Canada has ratified the 
United Nations Convention on the 
Conservation of Biological Diversity,









providing legal protection for species at risk 
will complement existing legislation and 
will, in part, meet Canada's commitments 
under that Convention,









the Government of Canada is committed to 
conserving biological diversity and to the 
principle that, if there are threats of serious 
or irreversible damage to a wildlife species, 
cost-effective measures to prevent the 
reduction or loss of the species should not 
be postponed for a lack of full scientific 
certainty,









responsibility for the conservation of 
wildlife in Canada is shared among the 
governments in this country and that it is 
important for them to work cooperatively to 
pursue the establishment of complementary 
legislation and programs for the protection 
and recovery of species at risk in Canada,









it is important that there be cooperation 
between the governments in this country to 
maintain and strengthen national standards 
of environmental conservation and that the 
Government of Canada is committed to the 
principles set out in intergovernmental 
agreements respecting environmental 
conservation,









the Canadian Endangered Species 
Conservation Council is to provide national 
leadership for the protection of species at 
risk, including the provision of general 
direction to the Committee on the Status of 
Endangered Wildlife in Canada in respect 
of that Committee's activities and general 
directions in respect of the development, 
coordination and implementation of 
recovery efforts,









the roles of the aboriginal peoples of 
Canada and of wildlife management boards 
established under land claims agreements 
in the conservation of wildlife in this 
country are essential,









all Canadians have a role to play in the 
conservation of wildlife in this country, 
including the prevention of wildlife species 
from becoming extirpated or extinct,









there will be circumstances under which the 
cost of conserving species at risk should be 
shared,









the conservation efforts of individual 
Canadians and communities should be 
encouraged and supported,









stewardship activities contributing to the 
conservation of wildlife species and their 
habitat should be supported to prevent 
species from becoming at risk,









community knowledge and interests, 
including socio-economic interests, should 
be considered in developing and 
implementing recovery measures,









the traditional knowledge of the aboriginal 
peoples of Canada should be considered in 
the assessment of which species may be at 
risk and in developing and implementing 
recovery measures,









knowledge of wildlife species and 
ecosystems is critical to their conservation,









the habitat of species at risk is key to their 
conservation, and









Canada's protected areas, especially 
national parks, are vital to the protection 
and recovery of species at risk,









NOW, THEREFORE, Her Majesty, by and 
with the advice and consent of the Senate and 
House of Commons of Canada, enacts as 
follows:
