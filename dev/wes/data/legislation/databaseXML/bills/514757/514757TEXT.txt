House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-7









An Act respecting leadership selection, 
administration and accountability of 
Indian bands, and to make related 
amendments to other Acts







Preamble


Whereas governments in Canada have 
certain capacities and powers facilitating 
good governance, accountability and 
economic development;










 Whereas representative democracy, 
including regular elections by secret ballot, 
and transparency and accountability are 
broadly held Canadian values;










 Whereas effective tools of governance have 
not been historically available under the 
Indian Act, which was not designed for that 
purpose;










 Whereas bands, within the meaning of the 
Indian Act, require effective tools of 
governance that can be adapted to their 
individual traditions and customs ;










 Whereas some bands refer to themselves as 
first nations while others refer to themselves 
as communities within first nations;










 Whereas the Government of Canada has 
adopted a policy recognizing the inherent 
right of self-government as an aboriginal right 
and providing for the negotiation of 
self-government;










 Whereas neither the Indian Act nor this Act 
is intended to define the nature and scope of 
any right of self-government or to prejudge 
the outcome of any self-government 
negotiation;










 And whereas the exercise of capacities and 
powers under all Acts of Parliament is subject 
to the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms;










NOW, THEREFORE, Her Majesty, by and 
with the advice and consent of the Senate and 
House of Commons of Canada, enacts as 
follows:
