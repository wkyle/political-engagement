BILL C-271









An Act to amend the Citizenship Act 
(revocation of citizenship)







R.S., c. C-29


Her Majesty, by and with the advice and 
consent of the Senate and House of Commons 
of Canada, enacts as follows:









1. Section 18 of the Citizenship Act is 
replaced by the following:







Notice to 
person in 
respect of 
revocation


18. (1) The Minister shall not make a report 
under section 10 unless the Minister has given 
notice of the  intention to do so to the person 
in respect of whom the report is to be made and










(a) that person does not, within thirty days 
after the day on which the notice is served,  
request that the Minister refer the case to the 
Court; or









(b) that person does so request and the final 
ruling pursuant to this section is  that the 
person has obtained, retained, renounced or 
resumed citizenship by false representation 
or fraud or by knowingly concealing 
material circumstances.






Nature of 
notice


(2) The notice referred to in subsection (1) 
shall state that the person in respect of whom 
the report is to be made may, within thirty days 
after the day on which the notice is served , 
request that the Minister refer the case to the 
Court.







Notice given 
personally


(3) A notice under subsection (1) shall be 
served personally unless the Court on 
application is satisfied that










(a) all reasonable efforts to effect personal 
service have been made, or









(b) the person is deliberately evading 
service,









in which case the Court may order that notice 
may be served by registered mail to the person 
at their latest known address or by such other 
means as may be most likely to bring the 
matter to the person's notice and may also 
order that the thirty day period mentioned in 
subsection (2) be increased, if the Court 
considers that it is necessary to do so to protect 
the interests of the person being served.







Appeal to 
Federal Court 
of Appeal


(4) A decision of the Court made under 
subsection (1) before or after the coming into 
force of this subsection, and any analogous 
decision by any person, body or court under 
prior legislation, may be appealed to the 
Federal Court of Appeal with the leave of that 
court.







Appeal to 
Supreme 
Court of 
Canada


(5) A decision of the Federal Court of 
Appeal made under subsection (4), whether as 
to leave to appeal or as to the merits of an 
appeal, may be appealed to the Supreme Court 
of Canada with the leave of that court.







Application 
on 
compassionat
e grounds to 
Governor in 
Council


(6) Where the Minister has given notice 
under subsection (1) and the person in respect 
of whom the report is made has made no 
request under paragraph (1)(a) or has made a 
request and withdrawn it, or the Court, the 
Federal Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court 
of Canada has finally ruled against the person, 
the person may apply to the Governor in 
Council for an order, on compassionate 
grounds, that no order shall be made under 
section 10.







Prior 
revocation


(7) Where the citizenship or renunciation of 
citizenship of a person has been revoked 
before the coming into force of subsections (4) 
and (5) and an appeal occurs under one or both 
of those subsections, and the court that hears 
the last appeal finally rules in favour of the 
person, the revocation shall be deemed not to 
have occurred.







Idem


(8) Where the citizenship or renunciation of 
citizenship of a person has been revoked 
before the coming into force of this 
subsection, the person may apply to the 
Governor in Council for an order, on 
compassionate grounds, declaring that the 
revocation is deemed not to have occurred.
