House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-311









An Act to protect the privacy of patients and 
the confidentiality of their health 
information







Preamble


Whereas the Parliament of Canada 
recognizes that the right of privacy is 
fundamental in a free and democratic society 
and includes a patient's right to determine 
with whom to share their health information 
and to know of and exercise control over 
collection of health information and the use 
and disclosure of and access to such 
information as has been collected;










 And Whereas the Parliament of Canada 
acknowledges that the principles and rules for 
health information must recognize the highly 
sensitive nature of health information, the 
circumstances of vulnerability and trust under 
which it is confided or collected and the 
fiduciary duties of health professionals in 
relation to this information;










Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:
