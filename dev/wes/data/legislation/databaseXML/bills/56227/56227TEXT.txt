49-50-51 Elizabeth II, 2001-2002 










House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-445









An Act to amend the Criminal Code 
(protection of child before birth)







Preamble


Whereas the Preamble to the Declaration 
of the Rights of the Child, adopted by the 
United Nations in 1959, provides:










Whereas the child, by reason of his 
physical and mental immaturity, needs 
special safeguards and care, including 
appropriate legal protection, before as well 
as after birth;









 Whereas certain substances, if they are 
consumed by the mother during her 
pregnancy, can damage the growth and 
development of the foetus, so that the health 
of the child is significantly injured;










 Whereas the legal protection of the health 
of children before they are born necessarily 
affects the rights and freedoms of mothers;










 And Whereas it is the intention of this Act 
to provide legal protection for the health of 
children before they are born, while affecting 
the rights and freedoms of mothers only to the 
extent necessary for that purpose;







R.S., c. C-46


Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:










 









1. The Criminal Code is amended by 
adding the following after section 218:







Definition of 
``child''


218.1 (1) In this section, ``child'' includes 
every foetus that its mother does not have a 
fixed intention to abort.







Consumption 
of injurious 
substance


(2) Every person who is pregnant and 
knowingly consumes a substance that injures 
or is likely to injure the health of a child she is 
carrying is guilty of an offence punishable on 
summary conviction and liable to 
confinement in a hospital or other suitable 
treatment facility that is ordered by the court 
until such time as two physicians certify that 
she may be released because she is no longer 
consuming the substance or the pregnancy 
ends, whichever is the earlier.







Report to 
physician


(3) A person who is pregnant and who is 
released under subsection (2) shall report to 
her physician weekly until the pregnancy 
ends, in order for the physician to determine 
whether the person is continuing to refrain 
from consuming the substance.







Reconfinemen
t


(4) Where the person's physician advises 
the court that the person has resumed the 
consumption of the substance, the court may 
order the person to be reconfined to a hospital 
or other suitable treatment facility until the 
pregnancy ends, or may make such other order 
as the court considers necessary to protect the 
growth, development and health of the child.
