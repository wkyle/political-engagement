BILL C-411









An Act respecting Louis Riel










Her Majesty, by and with the advice and 
consent of the Senate and House of Commons 
of Canada, enacts as follows:









SHORT TITLE






Short title


1. This Act may be cited as the Louis Riel 
Act.










PURPOSE






Purpose


2. The purpose of this Act is to reverse the 
conviction of Louis Riel for high treason and 
to formally recognize and commemorate his 
role in the advancement of Canadian 
Confederation and the rights and interests of 
the Metis people and the people of Western 
Canada, in recognition that










(a) beginning in 1670, under charter from 
King Charles II of England, the Hudson's 
Bay Company governed the territory 
known as Rupert's Land;









(b) Canada negotiated the purchase of the 
Hudson's Bay Company's rights in the 
territory without consulting the inhabitants 
of the said territory;









(c) the people of the territory led by Louis 
Riel refused to allow Canada to acquire 
jurisdiction over the territory without 
recognition of their rights;









(d) in 1869, after the Hudson's Bay 
Company ceased to govern the territory and 
before Canada acquired jurisdiction, the 
people of the portion of the territory known 
as Red River established a Provisional 
Government based upon principles of 
tolerance and equality of representation 
between the Metis majority and the French, 
English, and First Nations minority 
populations;









(e) the Provisional Government elected 
Louis Riel as its President;









(f) as a condition of its acceptance of that 
territory's acquisition by Canada, the 
Provisional Government drafted and 
unanimously adopted a List of Rights for the 
governance of the territory;









(g) the List of Rights was accepted by the 
Government of Canada as the basis for the 
entry of the territory into the Canadian 
Confederation and for the passage of the 
Manitoba Act;









(h) the rights of the Hudson's Bay Company 
to such lands were transferred to Canada on 
the 15th day of July 1870, whereupon 
Manitoba became the fifth province to join 
Confederation and the first province from 
Western Canada;









(i) the name ``Manitoba'' was submitted by 
Louis Riel and chosen by the Parliament of 
Canada as the name of the province;









(j) Louis Riel is recognized as the Founder 
of the Province of Manitoba;









(k) in 1871, Louis Riel, at the request of 
Adam G. Archibald, the 
Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba, 
organized the Metis to repel the Fenian 
threat to Canada for which he was publicly 
commended by the then 
Lieutenant-Governor;









(l) Louis Riel was elected three times to the 
House of Commons of Canada, on October 
13, 1873, January 13, 1874, and September 
3, 1874, but as a result of political pressure, 
was never allowed to take his seat;









(m) as a further result of the same political 
pressure, Louis Riel was forced to leave 
Canada;









(n) by the 1880s, the people living in the 
Northwest Territories had become 
increasingly concerned about the lack of 
respect by the Government of Canada for 
their rights;









(o) in 1884, they called on Louis Riel to 
return to Canada to assist them in 
negotiating once more with the 
Government of Canada in respect of their 
land claims and the very survival of the 
Metis people;









(p) all of the petitions sent by the Metis to 
the Government of Canada requesting a 
redress of the people's grievances and the 
recognition of their rights were ignored;









(q) the Government of Canada responded 
by sending troops against the Metis at 
Batoche;









(r) the Metis, under the leadership of Louis 
Riel and Gabriel Dumont, defended their 
homes;









(s) the First Nations joined the Metis in the 
defense of their lives, families, rights and 
territories;









(t) as a result of the events in the Northwest 
Territories in 1885, Louis Riel was 
wrongfully tried, convicted and executed 
for high treason by the Government of 
Canada on November 16, 1885;









(u) in March of 1992, the House of 
Commons and the Senate of Canada 
unanimously adopted resolutions 
recognizing the various and significant 
contributions of Louis Riel to Canada and to 
the Metis people and, in particular, 
recognizing his unique and historic role as 
a founder of Manitoba;









(v) in May of 1992, the Legislative 
Assembly of Manitoba unanimously passed 
a resolution recognizing ``the unique and 
historic role of Louis Riel as a founder of 
Manitoba and his contribution in the 
development of the Canadian 
Confederation''; and









(w) it is consistent with history, justice and 
with the recognition of the unique and 
important contributions of Louis Riel to 
Canada and to the Metis people that the 
conviction of Louis Riel for high treason be 
reversed and that his historic role be 
formally recognized and commemorated.
