Her Majesty, by and with the advice and 
consent of the Senate and House of Commons 
of Canada, enacts as follows:









1. (1) Subsection 335(1) of the Criminal 
Code is replaced by the following:







Taking motor 
vehicle or 
vessel without 
consent


(1) Every one who, without the consent of 
the owner, takes a motor vehicle or vessel with 
intent to drive, use, navigate or operate it or 
cause it to be driven, used, navigated or 
operated is guilty of an offence punishable on 
summary conviction and, notwithstanding the 
Young Offenders Act or any other Act or law, 
is liable to a term of imprisonment of not less 
than six months and not exceeding two years, 
or to a fine of not less than $1,000 and not 
exceeding $5,000, or to both, and, if ordered 
by the court, to pay an amount of damages 
fixed by the court as restitution to the victim 
of the offence.  










(2) The Act is amended by adding the 
following after subsection (2):







Payment by 
parent or 
guardian


(3) Notwithstanding any other Act or law, 
where a court finds a young person under the 
meaning of the Young Offenders Act guilty of 
an offence under subsection (1), and the court 
is of the opinion that the case would be best 
met by the imposition of a fine, damages or 
costs, with or without restitution or any other 
action, the court may, if satisfied that the 
parent or guardian of the young person 
contributed to the commission of the offence 
by neglecting to exercise due care of the 
young person or otherwise, order that the fine, 
damages or costs awarded be paid by the 
parent or guardian instead of by the young 
person.
