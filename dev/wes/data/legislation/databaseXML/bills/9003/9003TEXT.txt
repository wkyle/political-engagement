Information Act is replaced by the 
following:







Purpose


2. (1) The purpose of this Act is to extend 
the present laws of Canada to provide a right 
of access to information in records under the 
control of a government institution because it 
is the Government of Canada's duty to release 
information that will assist the public in 
assessing the Government's management of 
the country and in monitoring the 
Government's compliance with the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  







Principles to 
be applied


(1.1) The right of access referred to in 
subsection (1) is to be provided in accordance  
with the following  principles:










(a)  the information should be available to 
the public without unreasonable barriers 
with respect to cost, time or rules of 
secrecy;









(b) the information should be available in 
the format most useful to the requester 
whenever the format exists or can be 
created with a reasonable amount of effort 
and at reasonable cost;  









(c)  necessary exceptions to the right of 
access should be limited and specific; and









(d)  decisions on the disclosure of 
government information should be 
reviewed independently of government.

institution'' in section 3 of the Act is 
replaced by the following:







``government

the Government of Canada, including a 
department or ministry of state  listed in 
Shedule I,









(b)  any body or office listed in Schedule 
I, or









(c) a Crown corporation or a 
wholly-owned subsidiary of a Crown 
corporation as defined in the Financial 
Administration Act;  









(2) The definition ``record'' in section 3 of 
the Act is replaced by the following:

diagram, pictorial or graphic work, 
photograph, film, microform, sound 
recording, videotape, machine readable 
record, and any other recorded information , 
regardless of physical form or 
characteristics or the medium in which it is 
held, including material on which data is 
recorded or marked and that is capable of 
being read or understood by a person or a 
computer system or other means, electronic 
mail, electronic data interchange and 
computer conferencing , and a  copy of any 
of these things ;

Act, every person referred to in subsection (1) 
has a right to and shall, on request, be given 
access to any record generated by and under 
the control of a government institution if the 
record was created more than 30 years before 
the request was made, unless the record 
contains information the disclosure of which 
could reasonably be expected to threaten the 
safety or mental or physical health of 
individuals or be injurious to the 
constitutional integrity of Canada or the 
current conduct of international affairs, the 
defence of Canada or any state allied or 
associated with Canada or the detection, 
prevention or suppression of subversive or 
hostile activities.  










5. Paragraph 5(1)(b) of the Act is 
replaced by the following:










(b) a description of all classes of records 
under the control of each government 
institution in sufficient detail to facilitate 
the exercise of the right of access under this 
Act or, if the records are available through 
information systems accessible to the 
general public, in sufficient detail to inform 
the public how to gain access to the records.  









6. Subsection 9(1) of the Act is amended 
by adding the following after paragraph 
(a):










(a.1) the request is included among a large 
number of requests from the same person 
and meeting the original time limit would 
unreasonably interfere with the operations 
of the government institution,  









7. (1) Paragraphs 11(1)(a) and (b) of the 
Act are replaced by the following:










(a) before any copies are  made, such fee as

section, taking into account the following 
criteria in making the decision:
