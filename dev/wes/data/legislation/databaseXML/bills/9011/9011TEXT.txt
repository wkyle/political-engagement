PRINCIPLES






Principles


4. It is recognized and declared that










(a) the protection of society and the

respect to personal information about 
themselves, safeguards must be placed on









(i) the use and communication of, and 
access to, DNA profiles and other 
information contained in the national 
DNA data bank, and









(ii) the use of, and access to, bodily 
substances that are transmitted to the

Act.









NATIONAL DNA DATA BANK






Establish-
ment


5. (1) The Solicitor General of Canada 
shall, for criminal identification purposes, 
establish a national DNA data bank, 
consisting of a crime scene index and a

ner's duties


(2) The Commissioner's duties under this 
Act may be performed on behalf of the 
Commissioner by any person authorized by 
the Commissioner to perform those duties.







Crime scene 
index


(3) The crime scene index shall contain 
DNA profiles derived from bodily substances 
that are found










(a) at any place where a designated offence 
was committed;









(b) on or within the body of the victim of a 
designated offence;









(c) on anything worn or carried by the 
victim at the time when a designated

of the Criminal Code.







Other 
information


(5) In addition to the DNA profiles referred 
to in subsections (3) and (4), the DNA data 
bank shall contain, in relation to each of the 
profiles, information from which can be 
established

(b) in the case of a profile in the convicted 
offenders index, the identity of the person 
from whose bodily substance the profile 
was derived.

transmitted under subsection 487.071(1) of 
the Criminal Code or under subsection 10(3) 
for entry in the DNA data bank, the 
Commissioner shall compare it with the DNA 
profiles in the data bank in order to determine 
whether it is already contained in the data 
bank and may then communicate, for the 
purposes of the investigation or prosecution of 
a criminal offence, the following information 
to any Canadian law enforcement agency or 
laboratory that the Commissioner considers 
appropriate:










(a) whether the DNA profile is already 
contained in the data bank; and

information referred to in subsection (1) to 
that government, international organization or 
institution.







Communica-
tion of DNA 
profile


(4) The Commissioner may, on the request 
of a law enforcement agency in the course of

portions of the samples of the bodily 
substances that the Commissioner considers 
appropriate and without delay destroy any 
remaining portions.







Change in 
technology


(2) Forensic DNA analysis of stored bodily 
substances may be performed if the

substances to any person or use stored bodily 
substances except for the purpose of forensic 
DNA analysis.







Later 
destruction


(6) The Commissioner may at any time 
destroy any or all of the stored bodily 
substances if the Commissioner considers that 
they are no longer required for the purpose of 
forensic DNA analysis.







Mandatory 
destruction in 
certain cases


(7) The Commissioner shall nevertheless 
destroy the stored bodily substances of a 
person without delay










(a) if the person has been convicted of a 
designated offence, after the conviction is 
quashed and a final acquittal entered;

person is discharged conditionally, 
unless the person is convicted during 
those three years of another offence;









(c) if the person is a young person who has 
been found guilty under the Young 
Offenders Act of any of the following 
offences, after the expiry of ten years after 
all dispositions made in respect of the 
offence have been completed, namely,









(i) an offence referred to in any of 
subparagraphs (a)(i) to (v), (ix) to (xiii)

sexual assault) of the Criminal Code, after 
the expiry of five years after all dispositions 
made in respect of the offence have been 
completed; and









(e) if the person is a young person who has 
been found guilty under the Young 
Offenders Act of a designated offence that 
is a summary conviction offence, after the

Where pardon 
granted
