Her Majesty, by and with the advice and 
consent of the Senate and House of Commons 
of Canada, enacts as follows:









1. Subsection 123(4) of the Canada Busi
ness Corporations Act is replaced by the 
following:







Defence of 
due diligence


(4) A director is not liable under section 
118, 119 or 122 if the director has exercised 
the care, diligence and skill that a reasonably 
prudent person would exercise in comparable 
circumstances to prevent the wrongful act.







Factors to be 
considered by 
the court


(5) The court shall, in determining whether 
a director has, for the purposes of subsection 
(4), exercised the care, diligence and skill 
described in that subsection, consider, among 
other things, whether the director relied  in 
good faith on










(a) financial statements of the corporation 
represented to the director  by an officer of 
the corporation or in a written report of the 
auditor of the corporation fairly to reflect 
the financial condition of the corporation; 
or









(b) a report of any  person, including  a 
lawyer, accountant, engineer or appraiser 
whose profession lends credibility to a 
statement made by that person .









2. The Act is amended by adding the 
following after section 123:







Due diligence 
defence 
extended to 
other Acts of 
Parliament


123.1 Where any Act of Parliament im
poses liability on any person by virtue of the 
fact that the person is the director of a body 
corporate, and the Act does not contain a 
provision that the person is not liable under the 
provision of the Act that imposes the liability, 
if the person exercised the care, diligence and 
skill that a reasonably prudent person would 
exercise in comparable circumstances to pre
vent the wrongful act, that Act is deemed to 
contain such a provision.
