that pertains to a medicine, the Board shall, 
unless it sees good reason to the contrary, grant 
to any person applying therefor a licence 
limited to the use of the invention for the 
manufacture, use and sale of the medicine,

(2) If a patentee is able to show to the Board 
that for unusual or special reasons beyond the 
control of the patentee the patentee has taken 
longer than usual to establish a patented 
medicine in the Canadian market, the Board 
may consider that as good reason not to grant 
a licence respecting the medicine or to provide 
that a licence commence at a later date.

licence under section 89.1 and in fixing the

lowest possible price consistent with giving
