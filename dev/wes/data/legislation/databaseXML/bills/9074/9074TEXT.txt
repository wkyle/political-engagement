BILL C-243









An Act to amend the Criminal Code 
(protection of child before birth)







Preamble


 WHEREAS the Preamble to the 
Declaration of the Rights of the Child, 
adopted by the United Nations in 1959, 
provides:










The Child, by reason of his physical and 
mental immaturity, needs special 
safeguards and care, including legal 
protection before as well as after birth;









 WHEREAS certain substances, if they are 
consumed by the mother during her 
pregnancy, can damage the growth and 
development of the foetus, so that the health 
of the child is significantly injured;










 WHEREAS the legal protection of the 
health of children before they are born 
necessarily affects the rights and freedoms of 
mothers;










 AND WHEREAS it is the intention of this 
Act to provide legal protection for the health 
of children before they are born, while 
affecting the rights and freedoms of mothers 
only to the extent necessary for that purpose;










NOW, THEREFORE, Her Majesty, by and 
with the advice and consent of the Senate and 
House of Commons of Canada, enacts as 
follows:

1. The Criminal Code is amended by 
adding the following after section 218:







Definition of 
``child''


218.1 (1) In this section, ``child'' includes 
every foetus that its mother does not have a 
fixed intention to abort.







Consumption 
of injurious 
substance


(2) Every one who is pregnant and 
knowingly or recklessly consumes a substance 
that injures or is likely to injure the growth, 
development or health of a child she is 
carrying is guilty of an indictable offence and 
liable to imprisonment for a term not 
exceeding one year.







Order to 
protect child 
from further 
offence


(3) Where a person has committed an 
offence under subsection (2) and the court is 
satisfied that the making of such an order is 
necessary to prevent the commission of a 
further offence by the person in relation to the 
same child, the court may make any of the 
following orders:










(a) an order that the person be confined to 
a hospital or other suitable facility where 
the person's access to injurious substances 
can be controlled for so long as the court 
considers necessary to protect the growth, 
development and health of the child; or









(b) an order for such treatment of the person 
as the court considers necessary to protect 
the growth, development and health of the 
child.






Termination 
of order


(4) An order made under subsection (3) 
terminates when the pregnancy ends, whether 
by birth, miscarriage or abortion.
