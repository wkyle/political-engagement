EXTRADITION FROM CANADA









Extraditable Conduct






General 
principle


3. (1) A person may be extradited from 
Canada in accordance with this Act and a 
relevant extradition agreement on the request 
of an extradition partner for the purpose of 
prosecuting the person or imposing a sentence 
on - or enforcing a sentence imposed 
on - the person if










(a) subject to a relevant extradition 
agreement, the offence in respect of which 
the extradition is requested is punishable by 
the extradition partner, by imprisoning or 
otherwise depriving the person of their 
liberty for a maximum term of two years or 
more, or by a more severe punishment; and









(b) the conduct of the person, had it 
occurred in Canada, would have constituted 
an offence that is punishable in Canada,









(i) in the case of a request based on a 
specific agreement, by imprisonment for 
a maximum term of five years or more, or 
by a more severe punishment, and









(ii) in any other case, by imprisonment 
for a maximum term of two years or 
more, or by a more severe punishment, 
subject to a relevant extradition 
agreement.






Conduct 
determinative


(2) For greater certainty, it is not relevant 
whether the conduct referred to in subsection 
(1) is named, defined or characterized by the 
extradition partner in the same way as it is in 
Canada.







Extradition of 
a person who 
has been 
sentenced


(3) Subject to a relevant extradition 
agreement, the extradition of a person who has 
been sentenced to imprisonment or another 
deprivation of liberty may only be granted if 
the portion of the term remaining is at least six 
months long or a more severe punishment 
remains to be carried out.







Further 
proceedings


4. For greater certainty, the discharge of a 
person under this Act or an Act repealed by 
section 129 or 130 does not preclude further 
proceedings, whether or not they are based on 
the same conduct, with a view to extraditing 
the person under this Act unless the judge is of 
the opinion that those further proceedings 
would be an abuse of process.







Jurisdiction


5. A person may be extradited










(a) whether or not the conduct on which the 
extradition partner bases its request 
occurred in the territory over which it has 
jurisdiction; and









(b) whether or not Canada could exercise 
jurisdiction in similar circumstances.






Retrospecti-
vity


6. Subject to a relevant extradition 
agreement, extradition may be granted under 
this Act whether the conduct or conviction in 
respect of which the extradition is requested 
occurred before or after this Act or the 
relevant extradition agreement or specific 
agreement came into force.










Functions of the Minister

the inconsistency.

authority of the Minister of Foreign Affairs to 
which is attached a copy of a specific
