1st Session, 36th Parliament,
46-47 Elizabeth II, 1997-98










The House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-324









An Act to establish national literacy standards 
across Canada







Preamble


 Whereas literacy is a fundamental 
prerequisite for social and economic 
development and should be recognized as a 
basic human right;










 Whereas thirty-eight per cent of Canadian 
citizens have difficulty reading and writing;










 Whereas, on a national level, illiteracy 
costs Canadian society ten billion dollars 
annually;










 Whereas literacy programs in Canada 
generally lack the adequate funding, 
coordination with other programs and 
accessibility necessary for long-term success;










 Whereas the supply of unskilled labour in 
Canada is increasing, yet employment 
opportunities for these workers are 
decreasing;










 Whereas illiteracy serves to facilitate and 
perpetuate the economic stagnation of those 
whom it affects, which will in turn severely 
impede Canada's ability to maintain its 
position as an innovative and competitive 
world leader;










 And Whereas the Parliament of Canada 
has the objective of ensuring that a mechanism 
is established to facilitate the cooperation of 
all levels of government, student bodies, 
educational institutions, ministries of 
education, business, industry, communities 
and the media in reducing illiteracy;










Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:
