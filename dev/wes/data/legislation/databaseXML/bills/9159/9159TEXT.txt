Her Majesty, by and with the advice and 
consent of the Senate and House of Commons 
of Canada, enacts as follows:









1. Section 7 of the Canada Health Act is 
amended by striking out the word ``and'' at 
the end of paragraph (d), by adding the 
word ``and'' at the end of paragraph (e) and 
by adding the following after paragraph 
(e):










(f) linguistic duality .









2. The Act is amended by adding the 
following after section 12:










12.1 In order to satisfy the criterion 
respecting linguistic duality,










(a) as soon as possible, the province shall, 
in co-operation with the facilities of the 
province that offer insured health services, 
develop a program ensuring access to 
health services for members of the 
province's anglophone or francophone 
minority and, in so doing, shall take account 
of the human, material and financial 
resources of each facility and the social, 
cultural and linguistic characteristics of the 
members of the public served by the 
facility;









(b) the provincial health insurance plan 
shall offer insured health services in the 
language spoken by the members of the 
anglophone or francophone minority of the 
province, taking into account the 
organization of human, material and 
financial resources of the province's 
facilities that offer such services and, where 
applicable, in accordance with any program 
ensuring access under paragraph (a); and









(c) as soon as possible, the province shall 
take action to ensure that the management 
of any facility in the province that offers 
insured health services is placed entirely in 
the hands of members of the province's 
anglophone or francophone minority, 
where the number of users from the 
anglophone or francophone minority is 
sufficient to warrant that action.
