Her Majesty, by and with the advice and 
consent of the Senate and House of Commons 
of Canada, enacts as follows:









1. The Criminal Code is amended by 
adding the following after section 810.2:







Application 
for 
publication


810.3 (1) Any person who fears on 
reasonable grounds that another person, other 
than a young person within the meaning of the 
Young Offenders Act, who has been sentenced 
to a term of imprisonment for an offence under 
sections 151, 152, 155 or 159, subsections 
160(2) or (3), sections 170 or 171, subsection 
173(2) or sections 271, 272 or 273, will 
commit one of those offences after serving the 
sentence, may, within three months before the 
date set for the expiration of the sentence, with 
the consent of the Attorney General, lay an 
information before a provincial court judge.







Duty of 
provincial 
court judge


(2) A judge who receives an information 
under subsection (1) shall cause the parties to 
appear before him.







Adjudication


(3) The provincial court judge before whom 
the parties appear may, if satisfied by the 
evidence adduced that the informant has 
reasonable grounds for the fear and that the 
interests of society, in particular the protection 
of the public, prevail over the right to privacy 
of the defendant and any victim of the offence 
of which the defendant was convicted, order 
that the defendant enter into a recognizance 
and comply with the conditions fixed by the 
provincial court judge respecting the public 
disclosure of the defendant's name and the 
offence of which the defendant was convicted, 
including the condition set out in subsection 
(7).







Adjudication


(4) In making an adjudication under 
subsection (3), the provincial court judge shall 
consider










(a) the nature of the offence of which the 
defendant was convicted;









(b) the defendant's conduct while serving 
the sentence;









(c) the treatment and rehabilitation 
programs undertaken by the defendant 
while serving the sentence; and









(d) such other matters as the judge deems 
relevant in the circumstances.






Refusal to 
enter into 
recognizance


(5) The provincial court judge may commit 
the defendant to prison for a term not 
exceeding twelve months if the defendant 
fails or refuses to enter into the recognizance.







Variance of 
conditions


(6) The provincial court judge may, on 
application of the informant or the defendant, 
vary the conditions fixed in the recognizance.







Conditions - 
reporting


(7) Before making an order under 
subsection (3), the provincial court judge shall 
consider whether it is desirable to include as 
a condition of the recognizance that the 
defendant report to the correctional authority 
of a province or to an appropriate police 
authority in order to disclose the required 
information, and where the provincial court 
judge decides that it is desirable for the 
defendant to report for that purpose, the 
provincial court judge may add to the 
recognizance a condition that the defendant 
report to such authority.







Other 
provisions to 
apply


(8) Subsections 810(4) and (5) apply, with 
such modifications as the circumstances 
require, to recognizances made under this 
section.  










2. The Act is amended by adding the 
following after section 811:







Breach of 
recognizance


811.1 A person bound by a recognizance 
under section 810.3 who commits a breach of 
the recognizance is guilty of










(a) an indictable offence and liable to 
imprisonment for a term not exceeding one 
year; or









(b) an offence punishable on summary 
conviction.
