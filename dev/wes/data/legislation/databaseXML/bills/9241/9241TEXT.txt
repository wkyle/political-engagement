BANK ACT









1. The Bank Act is amended by adding the 
following after section 522:










PART XII.1









EQUITY IN COMMUNITY 
REINVESTMENT









Purpose









522.01 The purpose of this Part is to 
promote equity in community reinvestment so 
that every branch of a bank to which this Part 
applies, while respecting sound 
administrative and financial management 
practices, equitably grants credit or advances 
to persons having a residence or place of 
business in the electoral district in which the 
branch is located, thus correcting the 
conditions of disadvantage in access to credit 
experienced by persons from disadvantaged 
communities.

``designated person'' means a person having a 
residence or a place of business in the 
electoral district in which a branch of a bank 
is located,







``branch of a 
bank''
