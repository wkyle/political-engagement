Her Majesty, by and with the advice and

1. Section 19 of the Federal-Provincial 
Fiscal Arrangements Act is amended by 
adding the following after subsection (2):







Criteria for 
eligibility


(3) In order that a province may qualify for 
a full cash contribution referred to in section 
14 for a fiscal year, the laws of the province 
must make it compulsory for a person required 
by law to attend school, or who is excused by 
law from attending school by reason that the 
person is receiving satisfactory instruction at 
home or elsewhere, to remain in school or to 
continue that instruction, as the case may be, 
until the person attains the age of eighteen 
years.







Exception


(4) The criteria in subsection (3) are not 
contravened by a law exempting a person 
from attending school or continuing instruc
tion, as the case may be, until the person 
attains the age of eighteen years, on the basis 
that it is in the best interests of the person to be 
so exempted.







Apprentice-
ship


(5) For the purposes of subsections (3) and 
(4), ``school'' includes an apprenticeship 
program approved by the government of a 
province.  










2. The Act is amended by adding the 
following after section 23:







Consultation


23.01 (1) The Minister shall, as an essential 
and continuing indication of the interest of the 
Government of Canada in post-secondary 
education, consult with the governments of 
the provinces with regard to the relationship 
between the programs and activities of the 
Government of Canada and the governments 
of the provinces that relate to post-secondary 
education.







Annual report


(2) The Minister shall, no later than June 15 
in each year, lay before each House of 
Parliament a report on the consultations held 
in the preceding fiscal year pursuant to 
subsection (1).
