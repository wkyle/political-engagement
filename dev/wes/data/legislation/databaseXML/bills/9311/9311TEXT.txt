Her Majesty, by and with the advice and

Death within a 
year and a day


227. No person commits culpable homicide 
or the offence of causing the death of a person 
by criminal negligence or by means of the 
commission of an offence under subsection 
249(4), 249.1(4)  or 255(3) unless the death 
occurs within one year and one day from the 
time of the occurrence of the last event by 
means of which the person caused or 
contributed to the cause of death.










2. The Act is amended by adding the 
following after section 249:







Flight


249.1 (1) Every one commits an offence 
who, operating a motor vehicle while being 
pursued by a peace officer operating a motor 
vehicle, fails, without reasonable cause and in 
order to evade the peace officer, to stop the 
vehicle as soon as is reasonable in the 
circumstances.







Punishment


(2) Every one who commits an offence 
under subsection (1) is guilty of an indictable 
offence and liable to imprisonment for a term 
not exceeding two years.







Flight causing 
bodily harm


(3) Every one who commits an offence 
under subsection (1) and thereby causes 
bodily harm to any other person is guilty of an 
indictable offence and liable to imprisonment 
for a term not exceeding ten years.







Flight causing 
death


(4) Every one who commits an offence 
under subsection (1) and thereby causes the 
death of any other person is guilty of an 
indictable offence and liable to imprisonment 
for life.  










3. The portion of subsection 259(2) of the 
Act before paragraph (a) is replaced by the 
following:







Discretionary 
order of 
prohibition


(2) Where an offender is convicted or 
discharged under section 730 of an offence 
under section 220, 221, 236, 249, 249.1 , 250, 
251 or 252, subsection 255(2) or (3) or this 
section committed by means of a motor 
vehicle, vessel or aircraft or of railway 
equipment, the court that sentences the 
offender may, in addition to any other 
punishment that may be imposed for that 
offence, make an order prohibiting the 
offender from operating a motor vehicle on 
any street, road, highway or other public 
place, or from operating a vessel, an aircraft or 
railway equipment, as the case may be










4. Subsection 662(5) of the Act is replaced 
by the following:







Conviction

driving where 
manslaughter

(5) For greater certainty, where a court 
charges an offence under section 220, 221 or 
236 arising out of the operation of a motor 
vehicle or the navigation or operation of a 
vessel or aircraft, and the evidence does not 
prove such offence but does prove an offence 
under section 249 or 249.1 , the accused may 
be convicted of an offence under section 249 
or 249.1, as the case may be .
