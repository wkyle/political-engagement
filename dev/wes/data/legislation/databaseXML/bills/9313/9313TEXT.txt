An Act respecting pollution prevention and 
the protection of the environment and 
human health in order to contribute to 
sustainable development










[Assented to 14th September, 1999] 







Declaration


It is hereby declared that the protection of 
the environment is essential to the well-being 
of Canadians and that the primary purpose of 
this Act is to contribute to sustainable 
development through pollution prevention.







Preamble


 Whereas the Government of Canada seeks 
to achieve sustainable development that is 
based on an ecologically efficient use of 
natural, social and economic resources and 
acknowledges the need to integrate 
environmental, economic and social factors in 
the making of all decisions by government and 
private entities;










 Whereas the Government of Canada is 
committed to implementing pollution 
prevention as a national goal and as the 
priority approach to environmental 
protection;










 Whereas the Government of Canada 
acknowledges the need to virtually eliminate 
the most persistent and bioaccumulative toxic 
substances and the need to control and manage 
pollutants and wastes if their release into the 
environment cannot be prevented;










 Whereas the Government of Canada 
recognizes the importance of an ecosystem 
approach;










 Whereas the Government of Canada will 
continue to demonstrate national leadership in 
establishing environmental standards, 
ecosystem objectives and environmental 
quality guidelines and codes of practice;










 Whereas the Government of Canada is 
committed to implementing the precautionary 
principle that, where there are threats of 
serious or irreversible damage, lack of full 
scientific certainty shall not be used as a 
reason for postponing cost-effective measures 
to prevent environmental degradation;










 Whereas the Government of Canada 
recognizes that all governments in Canada 
have authority that enables them to protect the 
environment and recognizes that all 
governments face environmental problems 
that can benefit from cooperative resolution;










 Whereas the Government of Canada 
recognizes the importance of endeavouring, in 
cooperation with provinces, territories and 
aboriginal peoples, to achieve the highest 
level of environmental quality for all 
Canadians and ultimately contribute to 
sustainable development;










 Whereas the Government of Canada 
recognizes that the risk of toxic substances in 
the environment is a matter of national 
concern and that toxic substances, once 
introduced into the environment, cannot 
always be contained within geographic 
boundaries;










 Whereas the Government of Canada 
recognizes the integral role of science, as well 
as the role of traditional aboriginal 
knowledge, in the process of making decisions 
relating to the protection of the environment 
and human health and that environmental or 
health risks and social, economic and 
technical matters are to be considered in that 
process;










 Whereas the Government of Canada 
recognizes the responsibility of users and 
producers in relation to toxic substances and 
pollutants and wastes, and has adopted the 
``polluter pays'' principle;










 Whereas the Government of Canada is 
committed to ensuring that its operations and 
activities on federal and aboriginal lands are 
carried out in a manner that is consistent with 
the principles of pollution prevention and the 
protection of the environment and human 
health;










 Whereas the Government of Canada will 
endeavour to remove threats to biological 
diversity through pollution prevention, the 
control and management of the risk of any 
adverse effects of the use and release of toxic 
substances, pollutants and wastes, and the 
virtual elimination of persistent and 
bioaccumulative toxic substances;










 Whereas the Government of Canada 
recognizes the need to protect the 
environment, including its biological 
diversity, and human health, by ensuring the 
safe and effective use of biotechnology;










 And whereas the Government of Canada 
must be able to fulfil its international 
obligations in respect of the environment;










Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:
