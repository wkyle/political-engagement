The House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-400









An Act to amend the Tobacco Act (substances 
contained in a tobacco product)







1997, c. 13


Her Majesty, by and with the advice and 
consent of the Senate and House of Commons 
of Canada, enacts as follows:









1. Subsection 15(1) of the Tobacco Act is 
replaced by the following:







Information 
required on 
packages


15. (1) No manufacturer or retailer shall sell 
a tobacco product unless the package 
containing it displays, in the prescribed form 
and manner,










(a) the names of the substances contained in 
the tobacco product; and  









(b) any other  information required by the 
regulations about the product and its 
emissions, and about the health hazards and 
health effects arising from the use of the 
product or from its emissions.






Interpreta-
tion


(1.1) For greater certainty, the requirement 
under paragraph (1)(a) to display the names of 
the substances contained in the tobacco 
product on the package containing it does not 
include an obligation to list the components of 
such substances.
