The House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-50









A First Act to harmonize federal law with the 
civil law of the Province of Quebec and 
to amend certain Acts in order to ensure 
that each language version takes into 
account the common law and the civil 
law







Preamble


 WHEREAS all Canadians are entitled to 
access to federal laws in keeping with their 
legal tradition;










 WHEREAS the civil law, which is the jus 
commune of the Province of Quebec, reflects 
the unique character of Quebec society;










 WHEREAS the harmonious interaction of 
federal and provincial legislation is essential 
and lies in an interpretation of federal law that 
is compatible with the legal system, civil or 
common law, in each province in which 
federal law is applied;










 WHEREAS the full development of our 
two major legal traditions gives Canadians a 
window on the world and facilitates 
exchanges with the vast majority of other 
countries;










 WHEREAS the provincial law, in relation 
to property and civil rights, is the law that 
completes federal law when federal law is 
applied in a province, unless a law provides 
otherwise;










 WHEREAS to follow up on the adoption of 
the Civil Code of Québec, it is desirable to 
repeal the provisions of the Civil Code of 
Lower Canada in so far as they relate to 
subjects that fall within the legislative 
competence of Parliament and to replace 
certain provisions respecting marriage in the 
Province of Quebec;










 WHEREAS it is important to amend certain 
Acts of Parliament to ensure that each 
language version takes into account both the 
common law and the civil law;










 AND WHEREAS it is necessary to 
harmonize federal laws with the civil law of 
the Province of Quebec;










NOW, THEREFORE, Her Majesty, by and 
with the advice and consent of the Senate and 
House of Commons of Canada, enacts as 
follows:
