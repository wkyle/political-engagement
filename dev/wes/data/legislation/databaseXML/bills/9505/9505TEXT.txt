participating provinces; as

individuals who have consented or who 
may consent to be organ donors;

confidence, subject only to its release for 
the fulfilment of the purpose described in 
paragraph (b);






Standardi-
zation of 
provincial 
legislation


6. The Registrar shall endeavour by 
consultation with provinces










(a) to ensure that as many of the provinces 
as possible become participating provinces;









(b) to ensure that the legislation that 
provides for donation of organs in a 
province that wishes to be a participating 
province is compatible with the provisions 
of subsection 7(1); and









(c) to secure a sufficient degree of 
compatibility between the provincial 
legislation of participating provinces that 
provides for









(i) donation of organs and the promotion 
of organ donation,









(ii) notification of the appropriate agency 
of the death or imminent death of a 
person who is or may become an organ 
donor,









(iii) procedures to be established to 
assess the medical suitability of organ 
donors for transfer,









(iv) the training of hospital staff who may 
have to approach families of patients for 
consent to the donation of an organ, and









(iv) the keeping of records and 
production of statistics,






Participating 
provinces


7. (1) For a province to become a 
participating province, it must make an 
agreement with the Minister under section 8 
and it must have legislation that, by specific 
provision or by acceptance of a national 
standard:










(a) makes provision for consent for organ 
donation and refusal to donate any or 
specified organs, in writing









(i) by the donor or on the donor's 
incapacity or death by a person specified 
to consent on the donor's behalf to a 
donation,









(ii) in the case of a person who is a minor, 
by the donor and the donor's parents or 
other person specified by the laws of the 
province as the person to give such 
consent;









(b) specifies whether and how a donation is 
revocable and states whether or not the 
donor's next of kin have the right to revoke 
a prior agreement to donate made by a 
deceased person;









(c) specifies the procedure by which a 
determination of death of a donor prior to 
removal of an organ must be made;









(d) allows for the sharing with other 
jurisdictions of information on individuals 
intent to be an organ donor or not; and









(e) specifies how organ donation is to be 
managed within the province, either by









(i) the establishment of a body, or









(ii) the appointment or recognition of a 
governmental or non-governmental 
organization









to carry out the function.







Provisions 
need not be 
identical


(2) For greater certainty, it is not necessary 
for the legislation in a province respecting 
organ donation to be the same as that in other 
provinces that are participating provinces if, 
in the opinion of the Minister after 
consultation with the Registrar, the Minister is 
of the opinion that the difference will not 
unduly impede the operation of the Registry 
and the fulfilment of its objects.







Report to 
Minister


(3) When the Registrar is of the opinion that 
a province may become a participating 
province, the Registrar shall make a report to 
the Minister.







Annual report


(4) The Registrar shall, no later than April 
1 in every year, prepare and submit to the 
Minister a report on the operation of the 
Registry during the previous year and 
containing any recommendations the 
Registrar may wish to make concerning the 
Registry or organ donation.







Agreements


8. After receiving a report from the 
Registrar under subsection 7(3), the Minister 
may make an agreement with the province 
concerned to become a participating province, 
providing for










(a) information on organ donors residing in 
the participating province to be provided to 
the Registry and made available to other 
participating provinces;









(b) information on organ donors from other 
participating provinces to be provided to 
the participating province to assist it to 
identify organ donors;









(c) the information in the Register to be kept 
confidential except as necessary to fulfil the 
objects of the Register; and









(d) the promotion of organ donation 
throughout Canada through the 
development of a national public education 
campaign on organ donation that includes 
clear information on the issue of the 
establishment of death before organ 
removal.






Report laid 
before 
Parliament


9. (1) The Minister shall cause every report 
received pursuant to subsection 7(4) to be laid 
before each House of Parliament no later than 
the fifth day on which the House sits after the 
day the Minister receives the report.







Referred to 
committee


(2) The report referred to in subsection (1), 
when laid before the House of Commons, is 
automatically referred to the standing 
committee appointed by that House to deal 
with matters relating to health for 
consideration and report to the House.







Content of 
committee 
report


(3) The Committee in its report to the House 
may make general recommendations on 
human organ donation and on possible 
amendments to this Act.







Five year 
review


10. Five years after the coming into force of

one of its committees to undertake a review of 
the operation of this Act to date and the 
committee shall report to the House its
