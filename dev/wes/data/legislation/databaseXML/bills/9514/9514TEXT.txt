Her Majesty, by and with the advice and 
consent of the Senate and House of Commons 
of Canada, enacts as follows:









1. The Criminal Code is amended by 
adding the following after section 249:







Flight


249.1 (1) Every one commits an offence 
who, operating a motor vehicle while being 
pursued by a peace officer operating a motor 
vehicle, fails, without reasonable excuse and 
in order to evade the peace officer, to stop the 
vehicle as soon as is reasonable in the 
circumstances.







Punishment


(2) Every one who commits an offence 
under subsection (1)










(a) is guilty of an indictable offence and 
liable to imprisonment for a term not 
exceeding five years; or









(b) is guilty of an offence punishable on 
summary conviction.






Flight causing 
bodily harm 
or death


(3) Every one commits an offence who 
causes bodily harm to or the death of another 
person by operating a motor vehicle in a 
manner described in paragraph 249(1)(a), if 
the person operating the motor vehicle was 
being pursued by a peace officer operating a 
motor vehicle and failed, without reasonable 
excuse and in order to evade the police officer, 
to stop the vehicle as soon as is reasonable in 
the circumstances.







Punishment


(4) Every person who commits an offence 
under subsection (3)










(a) if bodily harm was caused, is guilty of an 
indictable offence and liable to 
imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 
years; and









(b) if death was caused, is guilty of an 
indictable offence and liable to 
imprisonment for life.









2. The portion of subsection 259(2) of the 
Act before paragraph (a) is replaced by the 
following:







Discretionary 
order of 
prohibition


(2) Where an offender is convicted or 
discharged under section 730 of an offence 
under section 220, 221, 236, 249, 249.1, 250, 
251 or 252, subsection 255(2) or (3) or this 
section committed by means of a motor 
vehicle, vessel or aircraft or of railway 
equipment, the court that sentences the 
offender may, in addition to any other 
punishment that may be imposed for that 
offence, make an order prohibiting the 
offender from operating a motor vehicle on 
any street, road, highway or other public 
place, or from operating a vessel, an aircraft or 
railway equipment, as the case may be










3. Subsection 662(5) of the Act is replaced 
by the following:







Conviction 
for dangerous 
driving where 
manslaughter 
charged


(5) For greater certainty, where a count 
charges an offence under section 220, 221 or 
236 arising out of the operation of a motor 
vehicle or the navigation or operation of a 
vessel or aircraft, and the evidence does not 
prove such offence but does prove an offence 
under section 249 or subsection 249.1(3), the 
accused may be convicted of an offence under 
section 249 or subsection 249.1(3), as the case 
may be.
