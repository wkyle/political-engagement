thereof.







Regulations


(1.1) The Governor in Council may, by 
regulation, exempt from the definition of 
``service'' in section 74.051 any service, other 
than a licensed broadcasting service, that, in 
the opinion of the Governor in Council, should 
be exempted in order to allow enterprises to 
which this section applies to remain 
competitive in their sector of activity, 
provided that the exemption does not deprive 
consumers of their right to competitive prices 
and product choices.







Regulations


(1.2) The Governor in Council may, by 
regulation, on the recommendation of the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage, exempt from 
the definition of ``service'' in section 74.051

exempted in order to achieve the objectives 
set out in subsection 3(1) of the Broadcasting 
Act.







Consultation 
with CRTC


(1.3) The Minister of Canadian Heritage 
shall consult with the Canadian 
Radio-television and Telecommunications

regulation that the Governor in Council 
proposes to make under subsection (1), (1.1) 
or (1.2) shall be published in the Canada 
Gazette at least sixty days before the proposed
