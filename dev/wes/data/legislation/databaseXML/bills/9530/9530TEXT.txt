CHAPTER 25 











An Act to amend the Criminal Code (victims 
of crime) and another Act in consequence










[Assented to 17th June, 1999] 







Preamble


 Whereas the Parliament of Canada 
continues to be gravely concerned about the 
incidence of crime in Canada and its impact on 
society, particularly on persons who are the 
victims of offences;










 Whereas the Parliament of Canada 
recognizes that the co-operation of victims of 
and witnesses to offences is essential to the 
investigation and prosecution of offences, and 
wishes to encourage the reporting of offences, 
and to provide for the prosecution of offences 
within a framework of laws that are consistent 
with the principles of fundamental justice;










 Whereas the Parliament of Canada 
recognizes and is committed to ensuring that 
all persons have the full protection of the 
rights guaranteed by the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms and, in the event of a 
conflict between the rights of accused persons 
and victims of and witnesses to offences, that 
those rights are accommodated and reconciled 
to the greatest extent possible;










 Whereas the Parliament of Canada supports 
the principle that victims of and witnesses to 
offences should be treated with courtesy, 
compassion and respect by the criminal 
justice system, and should suffer the least 
amount of inconvenience necessary as a result 
of their involvement in the criminal justice 
system;










 Whereas the Parliament of Canada, while 
recognizing that the Crown is responsible for 
the prosecution of offences, is of the opinion 
that the views and concerns of the victims 
should be considered in accordance with 
prevailing criminal law and procedure, 
particularly with respect to decisions that may 
have an impact on their safety, security or 
privacy;










 Whereas the Parliament of Canada wishes 
to encourage and facilitate the provision of 
information to victims of and witnesses to 
offences regarding the criminal justice system 
and their role in it, and regarding specific 
decisions that have an impact on them;










 Whereas the Parliament of Canada wishes 
to encourage and facilitate the participation in 
the criminal justice system of victims of and 
witnesses to offences in accordance with 
prevailing criminal law and procedure;










 And whereas the Parliament of Canada 
acknowledges the fundamental importance of 
an open justice system that treats all persons 
who come before it with dignity and respect;










NOW, THEREFORE, Her Majesty, by and 
with the advice and consent of the Senate and 
House of Commons of Canada, enacts as 
follows:
