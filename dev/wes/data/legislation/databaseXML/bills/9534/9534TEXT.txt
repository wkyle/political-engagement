The House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-230









An Act respecting a National Epidermolysis 
Bullosa Awareness Week







Preamble


Whereas epidermolysis bullosa is a group 
of rare and debilitating genetic diseases 
characterized by fragile skin and recurrent 
blisters that causes affected individuals and 
their families severe and devastating physical 
and emotional pain and suffering as well as 
financial hardship;










 Whereas epidermolysis bullosa is a 
life-long disease for which there is no cure;










 Whereas the treatment of epidermolysis 
bullosa consists primarily of dealing with the 
symptoms of the disease and is largely 
supportive;










 Whereas all forms of epidermolysis 
bullosa require good nursing and support care 
and severe forms of the disease require 
intensive nursing care similar to that given to 
patients who have been severely burned;










 Whereas the various problems 
encountered by a person who suffers from 
epidermolysis bullosa can be overcome with 
the support of parents, family members, 
friends, health and medical practitioners and 
persons in the community at large who are 
well-informed about the disease;










 And Whereas the Parliament of Canada 
desires to encourage both public and private 
investment in research and development into 
treatments and a possible cure for 
epidermolysis bullosa by raising awareness in 
Canada about the disease;










Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:
