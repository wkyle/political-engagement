1. Section 271 of the Criminal Code is 
amended by adding the following after 
subsection (1):







Sentences to 
be served 
consecutively


(2) Subject to subsections (3) and (4), a 
sentence imposed on a person for an offence 
under subsection (1) shall be served 
consecutively to any other sentence for an 
offence under subsection (1) or section 272 or 
273 to which the person is subject at the time 
the sentence is imposed on the person for an 
offence under subsection (1), unless the judge 
who sentences the person is satisfied that the 
serving of that sentence consecutively would 
be inconsistent with the principles of 
sentencing contained in sections 718 to 718.2 
of the Criminal Code, in which case the judge 
may order that the sentence be served 
concurrently.







Factors


(3) In deciding whether to make an order 
under subsection (2), the court shall have 
regard to










(a) the nature of the offence;









(b) the circumstance surrounding the 
commission of the offence;









(c) the degree of physical or emotional 
harm suffered by the victim arising from the 
commission of the offence;









(d) whether the offender abused a position 
of trust, power of authority in the 
commission of the offence;









(e) the criminal record of the offender; and









(f) the attitude of the offender respecting the 
offence committed by the offender.






Reasons


(4) Where the court makes an order under 
subsection (2), the court shall give both oral 
and written reasons for that order.










CORRECTIONS AND CONDITIONAL RELEASE 
ACT






1992, c. 20; 
1993, c. 34; 
1995, cc. 22, 
39, 42; 1996, 
c. 19; 1997, c. 
17; 1998, c. 
35


2. Section 120 of the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act is amended by 
adding the following after subsection (2):







Sentences to 
be served 
consecutively


(2.1) The portion of a sentence of 
imprisonment for life that a person who has 
been convicted of first degree murder or 
second degree murder must serve before the 
person may be released on full parole is, 
subject to subsection (2.2), that provided for in 
section 745 or 745.1 of the Criminal Code and, 
in addition, where the person is under another 
sentence of imprisonment in respect of 
another offence arising out of the same event 
or series of events or under any other sentence 
at the time the sentence of imprisonment for 
life is imposed on the person, the lesser of one 
third of any other sentence of imprisonment 
and seven years.







Subsequent 
murder 
conviction


(2.2) Subject to subsections (2.3), (2.4) and 
(2.5), where a judge sentences a person to a 
term of imprisonment for life for first degree 
murder or second degree murder and the 
person is at the time the sentence is imposed, 
subject to a sentence of imprisonment for life 
for another first degree murder or second 
degree murder, the judge may order that the 
person shall, in addition to the parole 
ineligibility period referred to in section 745 
or 745.1 of the Criminal Code to which the 
person is subject in respect of the conviction 
for the other first degree murder or second 
degree murder or the remaining portion of that 
period, as the case may be, serve on the expiry 
of that period or remaining portion of that 
period, a further period not exceeding 
twenty-five years in respect of the first degree 
murder or second degree murder for which the 
judge is sentencing the person.







Maximum 
parole 
ineligibility


(2.3) Where a person is required to serve 
more than one further parole ineligibility 
period referred to in subsection (2.2), the 
periods shall be served consecutively but in no 
case shall the total period of parole 
ineligibility exceed 50 years.







Factors


(2.4) In deciding whether to order a further 
period of parole ineligibility under (2.2) and in 
deciding the length of that period, the 
sentencing judge shall have regard to whether 
the total period of parole ineligibility would 
adequately denounce the murder and whether 
it would adequately acknowledge the harm 
done to the victim.







Reasons


(2.5) Where the court does not make an 
order under subsection (2.2), the court shall, 
orally and in writing, explain why it did not 
make that order.
