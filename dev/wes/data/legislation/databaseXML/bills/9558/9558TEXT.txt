[Assented to 17th June, 1999] 







Preamble


 WHEREAS the Agreement between the 
Government of Canada and the Government 
of the United States of America on Air 
Transport Preclearance was entered into on 
May 8, 1974;










 WHEREAS since that date it has become 
desirable to put in place statutory authority, on 
a reciprocal basis in both Canada and the 
United States, to facilitate the movement of 
travellers and goods across the border 
between the two countries by all means of 
transportation;










 WHEREAS it would facilitate cross-border 
travel and movement of goods if those 
provisions of American law directly related to 
the admission of travellers and the 
importation of goods into the United States, 
but excluding criminal law, were allowed to 
be administered in Canada;










 AND WHEREAS the administration of any 
provision of American law in Canada is 
subject to Canadian law, including the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, 
the Canadian Bill of Rights and the Canadian 
Human Rights Act;










NOW, THEREFORE, Her Majesty, by and 
with the advice and consent of the Senate and 
House of Commons of Canada, enacts as 
follows:

Assistance of 
a Canadian 
officer


(4) If a traveller refuses to go to a 
preclearance area, the preclearance officer 
may request a Canadian officer to take the 
traveller to the preclearance area, and the 
Canadian officer is authorized to do so.

persons acting 
under 
authority


12. (1) A preclearance officer is, if the

doing what the officer is required or 
authorized to do under this Act or the 
regulations, and in using as much force as is 
necessary for that purpose.







When not 
protected


(2) A preclearance officer must not use 
force that is intended or is likely to cause death

preservation of anyone under the officer's 
protection from death or grievous bodily 
harm.







Assistance of 
a Canadian 
officer


13. A preclearance officer may request a 
Canadian officer to assist in exercising the

preclearance officer may order the traveller to 
leave the preclearance area.







Refusal to 
answer not 
grounds for 
suspicion

question asked by a preclearance officer does 
not in and of itself constitute reasonable

of the traveller is necessary for the purposes of 
this Act or that an offence has been committed 
under section 33 or 34.







Assistance of 
Canadian 
officer
