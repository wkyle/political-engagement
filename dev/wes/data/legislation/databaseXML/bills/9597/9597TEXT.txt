2nd Session, 36th Parliament,
48 Elizabeth II, 1999










The House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-282









An Act proclaiming Emancipation Day







Preamble


 Whereas the British Parliament abolished 
slavery in the British Empire as of August 1, 
1834 by enacting an Act being 3 & 4 Will. IV, 
c. 73 (U.K.) on August 28, 1833;










 Whereas that Act resulted from the work of 
abolitionists who struggled against slavery, 
including Lieutenant Governor John Graves 
Simcoe who promoted the passage of an Act 
restricting slavery in Upper Canada, being 33 
Geo. III, c. 7 (U.C.) enacted on July 9, 1793;










 Whereas Upper Canada was the 
predecessor of the Province of Ontario;










 Whereas abolitionists and others who 
struggled against slavery, including those who 
arrived in Ontario by the underground 
railroad, have celebrated August 1 as 
Emancipation Day in the past;










 Whereas it is important to recognize the 
heritage of Canada's Black community and 
the contributions that it has made and 
continues to make to Canada;










 Whereas it is also important to recall the 
ongoing international struggle for human 
rights, which can best be personified by 
Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe and 
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr,










 And Whereas in consequence, it is 
appropriate to recognize August 1 formally as 
Emancipation Day and to celebrate it;










Now Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and the 
House of Commons of Canada, enacts as 
follows:
