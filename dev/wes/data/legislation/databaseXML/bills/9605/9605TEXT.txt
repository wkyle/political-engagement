2nd Session, 36th Parliament,
48 Elizabeth II, 1999










The House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-3









An Act in respect of criminal justice for young 
persons and to amend and repeal other 
Acts







Preamble


Whereas society should be protected from 
youth crime through a youth criminal justice 
system that commands respect, fosters 
responsibility and ensures accountability 
through meaningful consequences and 
effective rehabilitation and reintegration, and 
that reserves its most serious intervention for 
the most serious crimes and reduces the 
over-reliance on incarceration for non-violent 
young persons;










 Whereas these objectives can best be 
achieved by replacement of the Young 
Offenders Act with a new legal framework for 
the youth criminal justice system;










 Whereas members of society share a 
responsibility to address the developmental 
challenges and the needs of young persons and 
to guide them into adulthood;










 Whereas communities, families, parents 
and others concerned with the development of 
young persons should, through 
multi-disciplinary approaches, take 
reasonable steps to prevent youth crime by 
addressing its underlying causes, to respond to 
the needs of young persons, and to provide 
guidance and support to those at risk of 
committing crimes;










 And Whereas Canada is a party to the 
United Nations Convention on the Rights of 
the Child and recognizes that young persons 
have rights and freedoms, including those 
stated in the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms and the Canadian Bill of Rights, and 
have special guarantees of their rights and 
freedoms;










Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:

DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLE






Policy for 
Canada with 
respect to 
young persons


3. (1) The following principles apply in this 
Act:










(a) the principal goal of the youth criminal 
justice system is to protect the public by









(i) preventing crime by addressing the 
circumstances underlying a young 
person's offending behaviour,









(ii) ensuring that a young person is 
subject to meaningful consequences for 
his or her offence, and









(iii) rehabilitating young persons who 
commit offences and reintegrating them 
into society;









(b) the criminal justice system for young 
persons must be separate from that of adults 
and emphasize the following:









(i) fair and proportionate accountability 
that is consistent with the greater 
dependency of young persons and their 
reduced level of maturity,









(ii) enhanced procedural protection to 
ensure that young persons are treated 
fairly and that their rights, including their 
right to privacy, are protected, and









(iii) a greater emphasis on rehabilitation 
and reintegration;









(c) within the limits of fair and 
proportionate accountability, the measures 
taken against young persons who commit 
offences should









(i) reinforce respect for societal values,









(ii) encourage the repair of harm done to 
victims and the community,









(iii) be meaningful for the individual 
young person and, where appropriate, 
involve the parents, the extended family, 
the community and social or other 
agencies in the young person's 
rehabilitation and reintegration, and









(iv) respect gender, ethnic, cultural and 
linguistic differences and respond to the 
needs of young persons with special 
requirements; and









(d) special considerations apply in respect 
of proceedings against young persons and, 
in particular,









(i) young persons have rights and 
freedoms in their own right, such as a 
right to be heard in the course of and to 
participate in the processes, other than 
the decision to prosecute, that lead to 
decisions that affect them, and young 
persons have special guarantees of their 
rights and freedoms,









(ii) victims should be treated with 
courtesy, compassion and respect for 
their dignity and privacy and should 
suffer the minimum degree of 
inconvenience as a result of their 
involvement with the youth criminal 
justice system,









(iii) victims should be provided with 
information about the proceedings and 
given an opportunity to participate and 
be heard, and









(iv) parents should be informed of 
measures or proceedings involving their 
children and encouraged to support them 
in addressing their offending behaviour.






Act to be 
liberally 
construed


(2) This Act shall be liberally construed so 
as to ensure that young persons are dealt with 
in accordance with the principles set out in 
subsection (1).
