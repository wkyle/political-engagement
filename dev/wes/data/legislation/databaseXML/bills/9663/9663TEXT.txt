2. Subsections 117.04(3) and (4) of the 
Act, as enacted by section 139 of the

if any, seized;  









(c) the extent of the search;  and









(d) a report on any damage done to the 
premises or any property on the premises 
during the execution of the warrant.  






Authoriza-
tions, etc., 
revoked


(4) Where a peace officer who seizes any 
thing under subsection (1) is unable at the time 
of the seizure to seize the  authorization or 
licence under which the person from whom 
the thing was seized may possess the thing 
and, in the case of a seized firearm, a 
registration certificate for the firearm, every 
authorization, licence and registration 
certificate held by the person is, as at the time 
of the seizure, revoked.










3. Subsection 117.05(1) of the Act, as

days after the date of execution of the warrant, 
fix a date for the hearing of the application and 
direct that notice of the hearing be given to 
such persons or in such manner as the justice 
may specify.










4. The Act is amended by adding the 
following after section 117.05 as enacted by 
section 139 of the Firearms Act, chapter 39 
of the Statutes of Canada, 1995 :







Application 
for restitution


117.051 (1) A person whose property has 
been the subject of entry and search under the 
authority of a warrant issued pursuant to 
subsection 117.04(1) and whose property has 
been lost or damaged as a result of the entry 
and search may apply to the justice who issued 
the warrant for restitution in respect of the loss 
or damage.







Hearing


(2) A justice who receives an application 
under subsection (1) shall fix a date for a 
hearing on the matter and notify the applicant 
and the officer who applied for the warrant and 
such other persons as the justice sees fit and 
may, after the hearing, order restitution to the 
applicant, subject to subsections (3) and (4).







Persons not 
entitled to 
restitution


(3) No person is entitled to restitution for 
loss or damage resulting from an entry or 
search if










(a) the person is convicted of an offence on 
the basis of evidence discovered during the 
search and in the opinion of the justice the 
loss or damage was not excessive in light of 
the nature of the offence;









(b) the loss was of a thing that the applicant 
did not have the right to possess; or









(c) the loss or damage was a result of the 
applicant or other person on the premises









(i) refusing entry to a peace officer with 
a warrant immediately after the peace 
officer announced the demand for entry 
and offered identification,









(ii) refusing to immediately provide 
access to any part of the premises 
reasonably requested by a peace officer,

thing related to the purpose of the search

peace officer with information the peace 
officer requested in connection with the 
entry and search.






Exception


(4) Nothing in subsection (3) limits 
restitution for loss or damage that was not 
reasonably necessary in all the circumstances 
of the entry and search










(a) recognizing that speed in a search may 
be made necessary by the circumstances 
and that loss or damage may be a reasonable 
result of speed; and









(b) taking into account the behaviour of the 
applicant and other persons on the premises 
during the entry and search.  









5. The portion of subsection 117.06(1) of 
the Act before paragraph (a), as enacted by 
section 139 of the Firearms Act, chapter 39

application
