48 Elizabeth II, 1999










The House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-286









An Act to provide for parliamentary scrutiny 
and approval of user fees set by federal 
authority and to require public disclosure 
of the amount collected as user fees










Her Majesty, by and with the advice and 
consent of the Senate and House of Commons 
of Canada, enacts as follows:






Short title


1. This Act may be cited as the User Fee 
Act.







Definitions


2. The definitions in this section apply in 
this Act.







``Committee''
« comité »


``Committee'' means the Standing Committee 
of the House of Commons appointed by the 
House to study matters related to the 
regulating authority in question.







``regulating 
authority''
« organisme 
de 
réglementatio
n »


``regulating authority'' means the Governor in 
Council, a department, board, agency, 
commission, Crown corporation or any 
other body that has the power to set a user 
fee under the authority of an Act of 
Parliament.







``user fee''
« frais 
d'utilisation »


``user fee'' means a fee, charge or levy for a 
thing, service, use, authorization, permit or 
licence supplied or granted under the 
authority of an Act of Parliament, payable 
by any person and set pursuant to an 
authority established by an Act of 
Parliament, but does not include anything 
that is directly set by an Act of Parliament 
or by a calculation directly set by an Act of 
Parliament.







Proposal for 
establishment 
or increase


3. (1) Where a regulating authority wishes 
to establish, increase, widen the application of 
or increase the duration of a user fee with 
effect from July 1, 2000 or later, the regulating 
authority must submit to the Committee a 
proposal










(a) stating for what thing, service, use, 
authorization, permit or licence the user fee 
is charged;









(b) explaining the reason for the change in 
the user fee; and









(c) declaring the total amount that the 
regulating authority estimates will be 
collected in the first three fiscal years after 
the user fee is established or increased.






Minor change 
in incidence


(2) Where a regulating authority wishes to 
make a minor change in the definition of the 
persons to whom the fee is to apply, solely for 
the purpose of maintaining fairness or 
circumventing avoidance, the authority shall 
report to the Committee the reasons for the 
change, and if the Committee approves the 
change, the authority may make the change 
without making a proposal under subsection 
(1).







Committee 
review


4. The Committee shall review every 
proposal received pursuant to section 3 and 
shall report to the House of Commons with its 
recommendations thereon.







Resolution by 
Commons


5. (1) If a Committee has received a 
proposal and has not made a report to the 
House of Commons within one hundred and 
fifty days after receiving the proposal, the 
House may pass a resolution approving, 
denying or amending the proposal.







Setting user 
fees


(2) A regulating authority may not establish 
or increase a user fee after July 1, 2000 unless 
the authority has first made a proposal under 
section 3 and either










(a) the House of Commons has concurred in 
a report by the Committee approving the 
proposal or approving the proposal with 
amendments; or









(b) the House has passed a resolution under 
subsection (1) approving the proposal or 
approving the proposal with amendments.






Authority to 
follow 
recommended 
decreases


(3) Where a report as concurred in by the 
House of Commons or a resolution made by 
the House pursuant to subsection (1) 
recommends that a proposal be denied or the 
user fee be less than that proposed by the 
regulating authority as to amount, application 
or duration, the regulating authority shall set 
the user fee in the manner recommended by 
the report as concurred in or as stated in the 
resolution, as the case may be.







User fees 
shown 
separately


6. The amount of money collected by the 
Government of Canada as user fees must be 
identified and shown separately in










(a) the Public Accounts laid before the 
House of Commons pursuant to section 64 
of the Financial Administration Act; and









(b) every other report made public by the 
Government of Canada that shows the 
revenue of Canada and shows separately the 
sources from which it is generated.






R.S., c. F-11


7. The Financial Administration Act is 
amended by adding the following after 
section 19.3:







Application of 
User Fee Act


19.4 The power to issue a regulation under 
section 19 or 19.1 that establishes, increases, 
decreases or alters the application of a user fee 
within the meaning of the User Fee Act is 
subject to that Act.
