An Act to amend the Supreme Court Act







S.R., 1985, c.

Her Majesty, by and with the advice and 
consent of the Senate and House of Commons 
of Canada, enacts as follows:









1. The Supreme Court Act is amended by 
adding the following after section 52:










52.1 Where the question heard and 
considered by the Court concerns the 
constitutional validity of any Act or any 
provision of an Act, the Court shall consider 
any parliamentary or other extrinsic materials 
that deal with the purpose or intended effect of 
the particular provision or the Act being 
considered, such as commission of inquiry or 
law commission reports, debates of the House 
of Commons or of the Senate, or debates of the 
legislature of any province.










52.2 Where the question heard and 
considered by the Court concerns the 
constitutional validity of any Act or any 
provision of an Act and the judgment of the 
Court is not unanimous, the decision of the 
Court shall be deemed to be applicable only to 
the particular case being heard and not 
considered a precedent in relation to other 
circumstances in which the same 
constitutional issue arises.
