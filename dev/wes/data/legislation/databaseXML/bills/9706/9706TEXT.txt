 WHEREAS Parliament is cognizant of an 
historic opportunity to transform health

Canadian Institutes of Health Research as a 
flexible mechanism that will continually align 
health research funding with changes in the 
manner in which health problems and 
opportunities are identified, understood and 
addressed;










 WHEREAS Parliament believes that health 
research institutes should be created to 
coordinate, focus and integrate health 
research based on










an understanding of the multi-factorial 
nature of health problems and 
opportunities,

respect for, health researchers from all 
research disciplines, and the cooperation of 
a wide range of partners from all relevant 
sectors, the provinces and other countries,









the attraction of the best health researchers 
in Canada and the world and their

this transformation in health research can 
build on the legacy of excellence in health

while understanding that the institutions, 
technologies and environment for health 
research have become more varied and 
complex than in the past;










 WHEREAS Parliament recognizes that this 
transformation in Canadian health research 
will also enhance economic development in 
Canada and promote growth and job creation
