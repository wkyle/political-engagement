BILL C-326









An Act respecting the territorial integrity of 
Canada







Preamble


 Whereas Canada is a sovereign nation

state, best serve the interests of all Canadians 
and secure the reputation that it now enjoys in 
the world community as a nation in which two 
founding cultures and other diverse elements 
have demonstrated an ability to live and work 
together for the common good within a strong 
and united federation;










Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of

territories united under the Constitution to 
form a federal state;









(c) that there is no provision in the 
Constitution for the withdrawal from the 
federation of a province or territory;

of any part of the territory of Canada except 
with its consent and by due process of 
constitutional amendment;

unilaterally withdraw from the federation; 
and

such steps as it deems necessary to maintain 
and protect the territorial integrity of the 
federation in the interests of all Canadians, 
of whatever race and creed, in accordance 
with these principles.









TERRITORIAL PROTECTION






No 
referendum 
on unilateral 
withdrawal


4. (1) No province or territory shall initiate, 
authorize, sponsor or permit a referendum to 
be held on any question purporting to seek a 
mandate for the withdrawal of that province or 
territory from the federation without the 
federation's consent.







No secession


(2) No province or territory shall, either 
unilaterally or in conjunction with any other 
province or territory, attempt to or declare its 
intention to secede from the federation and 
form a separate state.







Maintenance 
of federal 
jurisdiction


(3) If any province or territory, acting alone 
or in conjunction with any other province or 
territory, contravenes this section, the 
Government of Canada may take such steps as 
it deems necessary to maintain federal 
jurisdiction over that province or territory and 
to enforce the laws of Canada as they may 
apply to residents of that province or territory.







Coming into 
force
