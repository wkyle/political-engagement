BILL C-428









An Act establishing Samuel de Champlain 
Day







Preamble


Whereas Samuel de Champlain 
established the first French settlement on St. 
Croix Island in Acadia on the 26th day of June 
in the year 1604;










 Whereas, at that time, Acadia was all that 
was known of Canada;










 Whereas the 26th day of June in the year 
2004 is the 400th anniversary of that event;










 Whereas Samuel de Champlain 
recognized the importance of this country 
Canada and was influential in the 
development of two further 
settlements - one at Port Royal on the Bay of 
Fundy and one at Quebec - which earned 
him the title of ``father of New France'';










 Whereas Samuel de Champlain was an 
expert geographer and cartographer who, 
through his exploration and mapping of the 
East Coast of Canada, the St. Lawrence River 
and the interior of Quebec and Ontario, paved 
the way for the European settlement of 
Canada;










 Whereas Samuel de Champlain possessed 
a unique understanding of the various native 
peoples that allowed him to establish, in 
alliance with the native peoples, a fur-trading 
network throughout Quebec and Ontario;










 Whereas Samuel de Champlain, through 
extraordinary determination in the face of 
great hardship, was instrumental in the 
founding of Canada;










 And Whereas the people of Canada wish to 
honour and recognize the valuable 
contribution of Samuel de Champlain to 
Canada and its citizens;










Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:
