2nd Session, 36th Parliament,
48 Elizabeth II, 1999










The House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-336









An Act to amend the Official Languages Act 
(provision of bilingual services)







Preamble


 Whereas the policy of official bilingualism 
has served as a source of national division 
rather than national unity; and










 Whereas the policy of national 
bilingualism was created without the support 
of the majority of Canadians; and










 Whereas it is estimated that the annual cost 
of official bilingualism for the public and 
private sectors is five billion dollars; and










 Whereas the international language of 
business is English, which constitutes a 
greater incentive for francophones to learn 
English as a second language than for 
anglophones to learn French as a second 
language; and










 Whereas while pursuing a policy of official 
bilingualism in the rest of Canada, the 
Government of Canada has tolerated the 
declaration of the National Assembly of 
Quebec that the only official language of 
Quebec is French, which has undermined the 
rights of Quebec's anglophones; and










 Whereas it is a matter of public concern 
that the Official Languages Act has resulted in 
discrimination against unilingual 
anglophones seeking employment with and 
advancement within the federal government;










Now Therefore Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:










 






R.S., c. 31 
(4th Supp.); 
1993, c. 28; 
1995, c. 11


1. Section 2 of the Official Languages Act 
is amended by deleting the word ``and'' at 
the end of paragraph (b) and adding the 
following after paragraph (b):










(b.1) ensure due economy in the provision 
of services in an official language by 
requiring that they be provided only where 
there is a significant proportion of the 
population that has the official language as 
a mother tongue; and  









2. The Act is amended by adding the 
following after section 23:







Demand by at 
least twenty 
five percent


23.1 For the purposes of sections 22 and 23 
a demand is significant for service in an 
official language if the number of persons who 
speak the language as a mother tongue is at 
least twenty five percent of the total number of 
persons










(a) who reside in the area, or









(b) who require the service while travelling









as the case may be.
