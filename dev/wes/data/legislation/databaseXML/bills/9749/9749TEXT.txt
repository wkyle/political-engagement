Preamble


 Whereas, on November 20, 1989, the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child was 
adopted by the United Nations General 
Assembly;










 Whereas the Convention was ratified by 
Canada on December 31, 1991;










 Whereas the Convention proposes a 
definition of ``child'' that should be applied 
uniformly throughout federal legislation;










 And Whereas the age of majority and the 
definition of ``infant'' should be consistent 
with the definition of ``child'';







R.S., c. L-5; 
1999, c. 31


Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:










 









1. Section 2 of the Land Titles Act is 
amended by adding the following in 
alphabetical order:







``infant''

meaning;

that any person making a transfer, mortgage,

expression ``full age of nineteen years'', 
where it occurs in Forms 7, 25 and 29, with 
the expression ``full age of eighteen years''.
