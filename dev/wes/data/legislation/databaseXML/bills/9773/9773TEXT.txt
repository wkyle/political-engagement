The House of Commons of Canada










BILL C-371









An Act to amend the Canada-United Kingdom 
Civil and Commercial Judgments 
Convention Act (definition of ``infant'' 
in matters originating in Canada)







Preamble


 Whereas, on November 20, 1989, the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child was 
adopted by the United Nations General 
Assembly;










 Whereas the Convention was ratified by 
Canada on December 31, 1991;










 And Whereas the Convention proposes a 
definition of ``child'' that should be applied 
uniformly throughout federal legislation, and 
``infant'' is often used in the same sense;







R.S., c. C-30


Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:










 









1. The Canada-United Kingdom Civil and 
Commercial Judgments Convention Act is 
amended by adding the following after 
section 2:







``Infant'' 
defined


2.1 In this Act, in respect of any matter that 
originates in Canada or in respect of any 
matter where Canadian law is determined to 
be the proper law, ``infant'' means a person 
who is less than eighteen years of age.
