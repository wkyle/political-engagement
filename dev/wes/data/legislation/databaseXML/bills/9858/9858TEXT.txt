196.12 (1) A military judge, on ex parte 
application in the prescribed form, may issue 
a warrant in the prescribed form authorizing 
the taking for the purpose of forensic DNA 
analysis, from a person subject to the Code of 
Service Discipline, of any number of samples 
of bodily substances that is reasonably 
required for that purpose, if the military judge 
is satisfied by information on oath that it is in 
the best interests of the administration of 
justice to do so and that there are reasonable 
grounds to believe










(a) that a designated offence has been 
committed;









(b) that a bodily substance has been found 
or obtained

the commission of the offence;









(c) that the person subject to the Code of 
Service Discipline was a party to the 
offence; and









(d) that forensic DNA analysis of a bodily 
substance from the person will provide 
evidence about whether the bodily 
substance referred to in paragraph (b) was 
from that person.






Criteria


(2) In considering whether to issue the 
warrant, the military judge shall have regard 
to all relevant matters, including










(a) the nature of the offence and the 
circumstances surrounding its commission; 
and









(b) whether there is









(i) a peace officer who is able, by virtue 
of training or experience, to obtain a 
bodily substance from the person, or









(ii) another person who is able, by virtue 
of training or experience, to obtain under 
the direction of a peace officer a bodily 
substance from the person.






Telewarrants


196.13 (1) If a peace officer believes that it 
would be impracticable to appear personally 
before a military judge to apply for a warrant, 
the peace officer may submit an information 
on oath to the judge by telephone or other 
means of telecommunication.







Contents of 
information


(2) An information submitted by telephone 
or other means of telecommunication shall 
include, in addition to the information 
described in subsection 196.12(1),










(a) a statement of the circumstances that 
make it impracticable for the peace officer 
to appear personally before a military 
judge; and

for a warrant under this section.






Oath in 
writing


(3) If the telecommunication is in written 
form, a written statement by the peace officer 
that all matters contained in the information 
are true to the officer's knowledge and belief 
is deemed to be a statement made under oath.







Information 
filed with 
Court Martial 
Adminis-
trator


(4) The military judge shall, as soon as 
practicable, certify the information as to time 
and date of receipt, and cause it to be filed with

information that is to be filed is the verbatim 
record, or a transcription of it, certified by the 
judge as to its contents and time and date of 
receipt.







Formalities 
respecting 
warrant and 
facsimiles


(5) When a military judge issues a warrant 
by telephone or other means of

paragraph (5)(b);









(c) the peace officer shall procure another 
facsimile of the warrant; and

Proof of 
authorization


(7) In any proceeding in which it is material 
for a court to be satisfied that the taking of 
samples of a bodily substance was authorized 
by a warrant issued by telephone or other 
means of telecommunication, the absence of 
the information or warrant, signed by the 
military judge and carrying on its face a 
notation of the time, date and place of 
issuance, is, in the absence of evidence to the 
contrary, proof that the taking of the samples 
was not authorized.







Duplicates 
and facsimiles 
acceptable


(8) A duplicate or a facsimile of an 
information or a warrant has the same 
probative force as the original for the purpose

person is found guilty of a designated offence, 
the court martial

an order in the prescribed form authorizing 
the taking, from that person, for the purpose 
of forensic DNA analysis, of any number of 
samples of bodily substances that is

that it is in the best interests of the 
administration of justice to do so.






Exception


(2) The court martial is not required to make 
an order under paragraph (1)(a) if it is satisfied 
that the person has established that, were the 
order made, the impact on the privacy and 
security of the person would be grossly 
disproportionate to the public interest in the 
protection of society and the proper 
administration of justice, to be achieved 
through the early detection, arrest and 
conviction of offenders.







Criteria


(3) In deciding whether to make an order 
under paragraph (1)(b), the court martial shall 
consider the nature of the offence and the 
circumstances surrounding its commission, 
any previous convictions by a service tribunal

would have on the privacy and security of the 
person and shall give reasons for its decision.

prosecutor, make an order in the prescribed 
form authorizing the taking, from that person, 
for the purpose of forensic DNA analysis, of 
any number of samples of bodily substances 
that is reasonably required for that purpose, if 
the court martial is satisfied that it is in the best 
interests of the administration of justice to do 
so.







Criteria


(2) In deciding whether to make the order, 
the court martial shall consider the nature of 
the offence and the circumstances 
surrounding its commission, any previous

the privacy and security of the person and shall 
give reasons for its decision.







No order


196.16 An order shall not be made under 
section 196.14 or 196.15 if the prosecutor

contains a DNA profile of the person in 
question.

take place


196.17 (1) Samples of bodily substances
