Her Majesty, by and with the advice and

1. (1) Paragraph 33(1)(b) of the 
Competition Act is replaced by the 
following:










(b) in the case of an offence under section 
52.1 or 52.2 , if the offence is committed or 
continued,









(i) injury to competition will result, or









(ii) one or more persons are likely to 
suffer damage from the commission of 
the offence that will be substantially 
greater than any damage that persons 
named in the application are likely to 
suffer from an injunction issued under 
this subsection in the event that it is 
subsequently found that an offence under 
section 52.1 or, as the case may be, under 
section 52.2  has not been committed, 
was not about to be committed and was 
not likely to be committed.









(2) Section 33 of the Act is amended by 
adding the following after subsection (1.1):







Game of 
chance


(1.2) An injunction issued in respect of an 
offence under section 52.2 may forbid any 
person from supplying to another person a 
product that is or is likely to be used for the 
commission or continuation of such an 
offence, where the person being supplied or, in 
the case of a corporation, any of its officers or 
directors, was previously










(a) convicted of an offence under section 
52.2 or an offence under section 52 in 
respect of conduct prohibited by section 
52.2; or









(b) punished for the contravention of an 
order made under this section or section 34 
in respect of the commission, continuation 
or repetition of an offence referred to in 
paragraph (a).  









2. The Act is amended by adding the 
following after section 52.1:







Game of 
chance


52.2 (1) Subject to subsection (2), no person 
shall, for the purpose of promoting, directly or 
indirectly, the supply or use of a product, or for 
the purpose of promoting, directly or 
indirectly, any business interest, cause to be 
delivered, by mail or through any other system 
of delivery, printed material that conveys the 
general impression that the recipient of the 
printed material has won a prize or advantage, 
and the distribution of such prize or advantage 
or any request for information regarding them 
is conditional on the prior payment of a sum of 
money or specific telephone charges.







For greater 
certainty


(2) Where the printed material indicates 
that it is necessary to make a telephone call in 
order to obtain information regarding the 
prizes to be won or how to obtain them and 
specific charges apply to the telephone call, 
such charges are deemed to be specific 
telephone charges for the purposes of 
subsection (1).







Due diligence


(3) No person shall be convicted of an 
offence under this section who establishes that 
the person exercised due diligence to prevent 
the commission of the offence.







Offences by 
employees or 
agents


(4) Notwithstanding subsection (3), in the 
prosecution of a corporation for an offence 
under this section, it is sufficient proof of the 
offence to establish that it was committed by 
an employee or agent of the corporation, 
whether or not the employee or agent is 
identified, unless the corporation establishes 
that the corporation exercised due diligence to 
prevent the commission of the offence.







Liability of 
officers and 
directors


(5) Where a corporation commits an 
offence under this section, any officer or 
director of the corporation who is in a position 
to direct or influence the policies of the 
corporation in respect of conduct prohibited 
by this section is a party to and guilty of the 
offence and is liable to the punishment 
provided for the offence, whether or not the 
corporation has been prosecuted or convicted, 
unless the officer or director establishes that 
the officer or director exercised due diligence 
to prevent the commission of the offence.







Offence and 
punishment


(6) Any person who contravenes subsection 
(1) is guilty of an offence and liable










(a) on conviction on indictment, to a fine in 
the discretion of the court or to 
imprisonment for a term not exceeding five 
years, or to both; or









(b) on summary conviction, to a fine not 
exceeding $200,000 or to imprisonment for 
a term not exceeding one year, or to both.






Sentencing


(7) In sentencing a person convicted of an 
offence under this section, the court shall 
consider, among other factors, the following 
aggravating factors:










(a) the use of lists of persons previously 
victimized by those convicted of fraud 
under the Criminal Code or of an offence 
under section 52 or 52.1 of this Act;









(b) characteristics of the persons to whom 
the printed material was directed, including 
classes of persons who are especially 
vulnerable to misleading advertising;









(c) the amount of the proceeds realized by 
the person from the offence under this 
section; and









(d) previous convictions of the person under 
this section or section 52.1, or under section 
52 in respect of conduct prohibited by this 
section.  









3. Subsection 73(1) of the Act is replaced 
by the following:

General of Canada may institute and conduct 
any prosecution or other proceedings under 
section 34, any of sections 45 to 51 and section 
61 or, where the proceedings are on 
indictment, under section 52, 52.1, 52.2,  55, 
55.1 or 66, in the Federal Court - Trial 
Division, and for the purposes of the 
prosecution or other proceedings, the Federal 
Court - Trial Division has all the powers and 
jurisdiction of a superior court of criminal 
jurisdiction under the Criminal Code and 
under this Act.

following:
