Notice of

compared to the week before the proposal is to 
take effect, of at least 50% of the weekly 
passenger-carrying capacity of all licensees 
operating year-round non-stop scheduled air 
services between those two points, the 
licensee shall give notice of the proposal in the 
prescribed form and manner to the prescribed 
persons.







Discussion 
with elected 
officials


(1.2) A licensee shall, as soon as practicable 
after giving notice under subsection (1) or

licensee the impact of the proposed 
discontinuance or reduction.







Notice period

proposal referred to in subsection (1) or (1.1) 
until the expiry of 120 days, or 30 days if the 
service referred to in that subsection has been

notice is given or until the expiry of any 
shorter period that the Agency may, on 
application by the licensee, specify by order.







Considera-
tions re 
whether 
exemption to 
be granted


(3) In considering whether to specify a 
shorter period under subsection (2), the

point or between the points is or is likely to

4. Section 66 of the Act is replaced by the 
following:







Unreasonable 
fares or rates


66. (1) If, on complaint in writing to the 
Agency by any person, the Agency finds that 
a licensee, including affiliated licensees, is the 
only person providing a domestic service 
between two points and that a fare, cargo rate 
or increase in a fare or cargo rate published or 
offered in respect of the service is 
unreasonable, the Agency may, by order,










(a) disallow the fare, rate or increase;









(b) direct the licensee to amend its tariff by 
reducing the fare, rate or increase by the 
amounts and for the periods that the Agency 
considers reasonable in the circumstances; 
or









(c) direct the licensee, if practicable, to 
refund amounts specified by the Agency, 
with interest calculated in the prescribed 
manner, to persons determined by the 
Agency to have been overcharged by the 
licensee.






Complaint of 
inadequate 
range of fares 
or rates


(2) If, on complaint in writing to the Agency 
by any person, the Agency finds that a 
licensee, including affiliated licensees, is the 
only person providing a domestic service 
between two points and that it is offering an 
inadequate range of fares or cargo rates in 
respect of that service, the Agency may, by 
order, direct the licensee, for a period that the 
Agency considers reasonable in the 
circumstances, to publish and apply in respect 
of that service one or more additional fares or 
cargo rates that the Agency considers 
reasonable in the circumstances.







Relevant 
information


(3) When making a finding under 
subsection (1) or (2) that a fare, cargo rate or 
increase in a fare or cargo rate published or 
offered in respect of a domestic service 
between two points is unreasonable or that a 
licensee is offering an inadequate range of 
fares or cargo rates in respect of a domestic 
service between two points, the Agency shall 
consider










(a) historical data respecting fares or cargo 
rates applicable to domestic services 
between those two points;









(b) fares or cargo rates applicable to similar 
domestic services offered by the licensee 
and one or more other licensees using 
similar aircraft, including terms and 
conditions of carriage and, in the case of 
fares, the number of seats available at those 
fares;









(b.1) the competition from other modes of 
transportation, if the finding is in respect of 
a cargo rate, an increase in a cargo rate or a 
range of cargo rates; and









(c) any other information that may be 
provided by the licensee, including 
information that the licensee provides 
under section 83.






Alternative 
domestic 
services


(4) The Agency may find that a licensee is 
the only person providing a domestic service 
between two points if every alternative 
domestic service between those points is, in 
the opinion of the Agency, unreasonable, 
taking into consideration the number of stops, 
the number of seats offered, the frequency of 
service, the flight connections and the total 
travel time.
