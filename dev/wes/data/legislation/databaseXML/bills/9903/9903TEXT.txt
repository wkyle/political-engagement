Her Majesty, by and with the advice and 
consent of the Senate and House of Commons 
of Canada, enacts as follows:






R.S., c. C-34; 
R.S., c. 19 
(2nd Supp.)


COMPETITION ACT









1. Section 45 of the Competition Act is 
replaced by the following:







Collusion


45. (1) For the purposes of this section, 
``collusion'' means an agreement or 
arrangement between a person and one or 
more competitors of the person in relation to 
the production, supply or acquisition of any 
product where the person knew, or ought 
reasonably to have known, that the agreement 
or arrangement, if implemented, would or 
would likely have the effect of










(a) fixing, establishing, controlling or 
maintaining the minimum price of the 
product;









(b) allocating any markets, territories, 
customers or sales for the product as 
between the person and the competitor;









(c) boycotting a competitor or a 
competitor's suppliers or customers; or









(d) preventing, eliminating, lessening or 
otherwise limiting the production or supply 
of the product.






Idem


(2) Every one who participates in collusion 
is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable 
to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five 
years or to a fine not exceeding ten million 
dollars or to both.







Proof of 
Collusion


(3) In any prosecution under subsection (2), 
the court may infer the existence of collusion 
from circumstantial evidence with or without 
direct evidence of communication between or 
among the alleged participants to the 
collusion but, for greater certainty, the 
agreement or arrangement must be proved 
beyond a reasonable doubt.







Defence


(4) Subject to subsection (5), in a 
prosecution under subsection (2), the court 
shall not convict the accused if the collusion 
relates only to the export of products from 
Canada.







Exception


(5) Subsection (4) does not apply if the 
collusion










(a) has resulted in or is likely to result in a 
reduction or limitation of the real value of 
exports of a product;









(b) has restricted or is likely to restrict any 
person from entering into or expanding the 
business of exporting products from 
Canada; or









(c) has prevented or lessened or is likely to 
prevent or lessen competition in the supply 
of services facilitating the export of 
products from Canada.






Defences


(6) In a prosecution under subsection (2), 
the court shall not convict the accused if it 
finds that the collusion relates only to a service 
and to standards of competence and integrity 
that are reasonably necessary for the 
protection of the public










(a) in the practice of a trade or profession 
relating to the service; or









(b) in the collection and dissemination of 
information relating to the service.






Exceptions


(7) An agreement or arrangement shall not 
be considered to be collusion if










(a) it is between or among only federal 
financial institutions as described in 
subsection 49(1);









(b) it is made only among companies each 
of which is, in respect of every one of the 
others, an affiliate;









(c) notice of it was given to the 
Commissioner pursuant to subsection 
79.2(1);









(d) it is ancillary to, and reasonably 
necessary for, another agreement or 
arrangement among the same participants 
and the other agreement or arrangement 
would not itself constitute collusion, when 
considered on a separate basis; or









(e) the participants collectively do not 
account for, or control, at least 25% of the 
relevant market for the product affected by 
the agreement or arrangement.









2. Section 45.1 of the Act is replaced by 
the following:







Where 
application 
made under 
section 79, 
79.1 or 92


45.1 No proceedings may be commenced 
under subsection 45(1) against a person 
against whom an order is sought under section 
79, 79.1 or 92 on the basis of the same or 
substantially the same facts as would be 
alleged in proceedings under that subsection.

dealing and 
tied selling


(2) Where on an application by the 
Commissioner, or a person described in

market, is likely to










(2) Subsection 77(3) is replaced by the 
following:







Market 
restriction


(3) Where, on application by the 
Commissioner, or a person described in 
subsection 77.1(2), the Tribunal finds that 
market restriction, because it is engaged in by 
a major supplier of a product or because it is 
widespread in relation to a product, is likely to 
substantially lessen competition in relation to 
the product, the Tribunal may make an order 
directed to all or any of the suppliers against 
whom an order is sought prohibiting them 
from continuing to engage in market 
restriction and containing any other 
requirement that, in its opinion, is necessary to 
restore or stimulate competition in relation to 
the product.
