BILL C-492









An Act establishing A Day for Hearts: 
Congenital Heart Defect Awareness Day







Preamble


 Whereas congenital heart defect affects 
more than 4,600 or 1 in every 100 children 
born in Canada each year;










 Whereas there are approximately 82,800 
cases of congenital heart disease in the 
Canadian population aged 18 years or less;










 Whereas there are approximately 12,000 
adults in Canada currently receiving 
follow-up cardiac care;










 Whereas the number of complex cases 
requiring follow-up cardiac care is expected 
to double by the year 2006;










 Whereas congenital heart defect is a 
birth-related defect and consists of 35 
different types of heart defects;










 Whereas congenital heart defect is one of 
the leading birth-related defects that causes 
death;










 Whereas congenital heart defect related 
deaths are caused by late detection, lack of 
donor hearts and failure of medical 
intervention;










 Whereas congenital heart defect requires 
more research in order to discover further 
surgical options and to accurately describe its 
origin, physical signs and symptoms;










 And Whereas the people of Canada wish to 
officially recognize the need for awareness of 
congenital heart defect so that early diagnosis 
and intervention become a top priority;










Now Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:
