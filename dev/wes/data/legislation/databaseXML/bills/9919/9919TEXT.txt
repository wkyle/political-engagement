competent jurisdiction for their loss resulting 
from the death against the person from whom 
the deceased person would have been entitled

other or to indemnify each other in the degree 
to which they are respectively at fault or 
negligent.







Exception - 
loss of ships 
and property


(3) Where, by the fault or neglect of two or 
more ships, loss is caused to one or more of

more of those ships, their liability to make 
good such loss is not joint and several.

responsible

a ship that is at fault or negligent includes 
liability of any person responsible for the 
navigation and management of the ship or any 
other person responsible for the fault or

or indemnity


18. A person who is entitled to claim 
contribution or indemnity under this Part from 
another person or ship that is or may be liable 
in respect of a loss may do so










(a) by adding the other person or ship as a 
party to a proceeding pending before a court 
or an administrative or arbitral tribunal of 
competent jurisdiction, in accordance with 
the applicable rules of procedure or 
arbitration agreement;









(b) by commencing a proceeding in a court 
or an administrative or arbitral tribunal of 
competent jurisdiction; or









(c) if the other person or ship has settled 
with the person suffering the loss, by 
commencing or continuing a proceeding 
before a court or an administrative or 
arbitral tribunal of competent jurisdiction.






Adjustment of 
settlement


19. The court or administrative or arbitral 
tribunal in which a proceeding is continued or 
commenced under paragraph 18(c) may deny 
the award of damages or adjust the amount 
awarded if it is not satisfied that the settlement 
was reasonable.







Limitation

20. (1) No claim may be made under section 
18 later than one year after the date of 
judgment in the proceeding or the date of the 
settlement agreement.

applicable to the original claim in respect of 
which contribution or indemnity is sought.

21. This Part applies notwithstanding that a 
person who suffered a loss had the opportunity 
to avoid the loss and failed to do so.







Contractual 
rights

person or ship that is found liable or that settles 
a claim are subject to any existing contract 
between that person or ship and a person from 
whom contribution or indemnity is claimed.










Limitation of Time






Limitation 
period for 
claim or lien


23. (1) No action may be commenced later 
than two years after the loss or injury arose to 
enforce a claim or lien against a ship in 
collision or its owners in respect of any loss to 
another ship, its cargo or other property on 
board, or any loss of earnings of that other 
ship, or for damages for loss of life or personal 
injury suffered by any person on board that 
other ship, caused by the fault or neglect of the 
former ship, whether that ship is wholly or 
partly at fault or negligent.







Extension of 
time by court


(2) A court having jurisdiction to deal with 
an action referred to in subsection (1)










(a) may, in accordance with the rules of 
court, extend the period referred to in that 
subsection to the extent and on the 
conditions that it thinks fit; and









(b) shall, if satisfied that there has not 
during that period been a reasonable 
opportunity of arresting the ship within the 
jurisdiction of the court, or within the 
territorial waters of the country to which the 
claimant's ship belongs or in which the 
claimant resides or has their principal place 
of business, extend that period to an extent 
sufficient to provide that reasonable 
opportunity.






Definition of
