BILL C-508









An Act respecting the protection of employees

public interest is served when employees are 
free to make such reports without fear of or 
exposure to retaliation or discrimination of 
any kind, and that the recognition of the right 
of employees to pursue appropriate 
communications with the public will reaffirm
